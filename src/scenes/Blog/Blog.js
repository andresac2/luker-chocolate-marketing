For them, the purchase of Cacao Fino de Aroma directly from Colombia without intermediate trade and at a fair fixed price is unbeatable, allowing us to makes sure that equivalent funds are paid directly to the cocoa farmers.</p>

      content: `<p>Our existence is condensed into a collection of moments, experiences, anecdotes, and conversations.  For us, it is the latter that makes things happen; memorable events that you never forget, events that transcend, that mark the difference and change the world. At Luker Chocolate, we believe that memorable conversations do not happen just anywhere. Ours, for example, have taken place under a tree.</p>
<p>Most of the people that work here grew up under cocoa trees, just like the thousands of farmers that work with us today spend much of their lives in their shade. At Granja Luker, our cocoa research centre, visitors from all over the world have been able to have hot chocolate for breakfast under gigantic legendary trees, many of which they have planted with their own hands.</p>
<p>But why do we place so much importance on the trees? Because the great conversations of our grandparents and parents on the future, those from which they found inspiration and made transcendental decisions, did not take place in an office with them dressed in a suit and tie; quite the contrary, they took place under the leaves of trees as they wore their ponchos and hats.</p>
<p>In our Cocoa Forest in Necoclí, we have been witness to the shade of the mythic Campano; an old tree that has sheltered different communities for generations, from the indigenous to the cocoa farmers, offering a space in its shade where people could sit to converse. We have dreamt, laughed, and cried under this tree.  We have found something relating to our humanity, we have connected with our roots, culture, and history. It is under this tree that we have forgotten our titles and our social condition, we have been equal; we have been sincere, we have confessed our greatest secrets and happily shared our differences.</p>
<img src="/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg" alt="Necoclí Forest">
<p>We have been chocolatiers in Colombia for 113 years and, even so, sometimes we forget that it is thanks to a tree that we can do what we do. There are no cocoa trees in Switzerland, in Belgium or France. They are here in Colombia, and they are part of our history.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-forest-friends.64e7c5c5.jpg" alt="Cocoa friends">
<p>We hope that the readers of this blog find an open space in which to talk and to share and build ideas. A safe place, where they can take off their masks as though they were under the shade of a great tree.</p>

      title: 'THE BIRTH OF A DREAM',
      date: 'JUNE 2019',
      content: `<q>I have a dream for which we need the joint effort of many… I want to set up a chocolate factory.</q>
<p>It was with this statement that José Jesús Restrepo founded Luker Chocolate 113 years ago. A company with a vision that even today, five generations later, is preserved, not only in one man and his family but in the hearts of the company’s 1000 plus collaborators.</p>
<p>Over a century later, the dream has grown. We know that we can contribute more to the country through chocolate and we are sure that, with the support of many, this idea is beginning to consolidate and become a model in which rural Colombia and its inhabitants are the protagonists. We no longer dream of just a chocolate factory; our purpose today is to transform lives through it.</p>
<p>The true story of Luker Chocolate’s social responsibility and sustainability is the account of a family legacy that started as a dream, and was then built and extended with all its members. In the search for Luker Chocolate’s highest purpose, we went back to look for its roots and found many stories of the legacy of a family, its values and convictions.</p>
<img src="/static/media/the-birt-of-a-dream-1.38cc0657.jpg" alt="">
<p>Let’s start with Maria de Restrepo, who was a member of Luker Chocolate’s founding family. Every Saturday, in Manizales, she would stand at her window to give out chocolate to the homeless for the sole reason of consoling them and making sure they had food in their stomachs. At that time, there had been no research on the “happiness of eating chocolate”, but what she did and the chocolate she gave out must have comforted many.</p>
<p>Jaime Restrepo, founder of the Luker Foundation, is said to have supported anyone who approached him with a great idea, he would spend time listening to their ideas and he financed some of these projects. In time, this gave rise to the foundation, which later had a great benefactor, Inés Restrepo Mejía, who has always supported causes around children, education and women. She decided to leave all her legacy to the foundation, today allowing the implementation of programs that have had a great positive impact in Manizales, in terms of education and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The story goes on thanks to the new generations of the family which continues to build the country. Many of them have been involved in social projects, foundations, a vocation for service, and the conviction that with the effort of many, it is possible to build a dream. All of the above is the inspiration for the construction of a sustainable model in which we want Luker Chocolate to last another 100 years as a business. We want it to be able to contribute to all those around us, our collaborators, farmers, their families and our customers around the world.</p>
<p>The company’s current leaders have opted to continue this legacy and take it to another level. Over the years, the company has evolved and found new opportunities, not only in the domestic market but also in international markets. In that evolution, it was decided that the chocolate business would take a different course from that of CasaLuker, the mass consumer business. This is how Luker Chocolate was born, a company that sells chocolate to the world; chocolate made with the best Cacao Fino de Aroma. This new business model goes from selling a product to offering an integral service around chocolate, with innovative, competitive equipment and, above all, with a superior purpose.</p>
<p>We began to renew the company internally, maintaining the over 100-year family tradition, but adding the new global trends addressing sustainability. We want to contribute to the country through an economic, environmental, and socially responsible model. In this sense, we have always been a company that has worked closely with Colombian farmers in the different cocoa regions. We have accompanied them through Granja Luker for over 60 years to train them as producers, so that they have a more technical understanding of the field, helping them to improve productivity and their quality of life.</p>
<p>However, a few years ago we began to ask ourselves about new paths for business, for the countryside, and for small farmers. In this search for new sustainable models for the cocoa-growing regions, which also largely coincide with the regions most affected by the armed conflict, we embarked on a new course towards planting our own crops. This is how we arrived in Necocli, in Urabá antioqueño, to open the way for cocoa in an area where violence was the protagonist for so many years. We arrived against all odds to plant 550 hectares of cocoa in a land that had long been used for livestock farming. The transformation was a milestone in the region. It went from five to 180 jobs, from a farm with only grass, to the planting of 600,000 new trees. Stability and future began to be considered through formal hiring; women began to play a leading role in the field.</p>
<p>There are still many challenges to overcome in the nearby villages. Multidimensional poverty rates are still very high and the aftermath of violence is still visible in the eyes of the children. The whole team that was embarking on this new phase began to wonder about our responsibility as a company. What more could we bring to the countryside, to the people, to the children, to our neighbors? This is how The Chocolate Dream was born, Luker Chocolate’s long-term vision to lead social and economic development in the cocoa-producing regions where we work. Little by little, the Dream became the DNA of the company’s sustainability strategy; we knew we could do more and we discovered how to do it. Today, Luker Chocolate has a strategy in which the economic, environmental and social components carry the same weight and in which the business model is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>We capitalized on all the good practices of more than 110 years in a model of integrated intervention in the territories, not only in Necocli, but also in Casanare, Huila, Tumaco and, in the med-term, the other cocoa-growing parts of the country. We know that we are responsible for the course Colombia is taking and for our planet. We want the Colombian countryside to become a protagonist, not because of the suffering caused by the violence, but because of its prosperity, its dignity, its potential for development, its knowledge, its art and its culture.</p>
<p>We have fully integrated our value chain to achieve this, first humanizing its links. We are no longer talking about raw materials but about farmers and communities; we are no longer talking about the transformation of cocoa but about equipment with purpose; we are not only talking about income but also about clients with life projects. We are also looking to make our value chain not linear but circular, so that the client can give something back to the countryside through projects created by us and financed by them, in order to improve the living conditions of the communities and farmers who work day by day to bring the best chocolate to their country.</p>
<p>The Chocolate Dream manages to open new dialogues with anyone who has a product made with our chocolate on their mind. Luker Chocolate is of the best quality but also carries within it the history of our Colombian countryside.</p>
<img src="/static/media/the-birth-of-a-dream.68663234.jpg" alt="">
<p>We know that many of us can join together to turn this dream into a movement that can travel the world. This is why The Chocolate Dream will soon open its doors so that all those who want to contribute with their knowledge, their experience and their time, can find a place where they can do so at Luker Chocolate.</p>

      title: 'WHAT DO WE MEAN BY A BRAND WITH PURPOSE?',
      cover: 'brick-luker.jpg',
      date: 'JUNE 2019',
      content: `<p>Before we can talk about a brand with purpose or a product with purpose, we have to define the purpose of a business.</p>
<p>In essence, the purpose of a business is to make a profit by satisfying needs. We can say that those businesses that effectively satisfy a need, and at the same time manage to charge enough to cover their costs and generate a profit, will have created economic value.</p>
<p>The problem with this, as is prone to happen nowadays, is that many companies have become obsessed with fighting within the same consumer segments as their competitors and worse yet, offering the same product or service. They have fallen into the trap of intensifying competition, investing huge amounts of money in advertising, and trying to excel by means of tiny incremental innovations. Gaining a point in market share over the competitor has become an obsession that consumes large amounts of resources, time and brilliant minds.</p>
<p>Having stated that the purpose of a business has to do with solving needs, at what point did we move away from trying to solve the large, urgent, and complex needs of our society? Is it not true that pollution, health, nutrition, housing, poverty, lack of water, violence and education, among many others, are needs? Why do companies distance themselves from society’s most complex and relevant needs? Why do we not see the important needs as the huge business opportunities that they are?</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2018, I had the opportunity to attend Professor Michael Porter’s Shared Value course at Harvard Business School. Professor Porter and his team invite us to reflect on how we have grown with the conventional wisdom that believes that social problems need to be solved by the government and NGOs, but not by companies. This road that we have travelled for decades is leading us to the destruction of our planet. Society in general has not been effective in solving the most serious problems. We are not on the right track. This is not the way forward.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that within the concept of shared value, at its core, a new notion of business strategy can be found and represents a real and powerful disruption to our understanding of business. Although it is a concept that is maturing in different ways, only the bravest entrepreneurs —those who dare to work with it—will help refine its understanding. Creating shared value means solving a social problem through a business model; a business that thinks like a business and manages to create economic value as a result of solving a social problem. And it is precisely the ability to create economic value —profit—that allows us to think about sustainable and scalable solutions, which is something that typically NGOs or governments cannot do.</p>
<p>In addition to the concept of shared value, there are many other lines of thinking that point towards a common interest. Among them, I invite you to study the powerful initiatives led by Sir Ronald Cohen and his ideas on Impact Investment, the vision of B-Lab and its growing and inspiring B-Corp movement, the different approaches within conscious capitalism and many other working groups and their experiences that we will be discussing on our blog. Independent of the academic preferences and affinities of each of the approaches, what I really want to invite our customers, suppliers, allies, entrepreneurs and businesspeople to do, is to start asking ourselves very seriously: What is the role we want our companies and our brands to play in the urgent mission to change the direction of our society? How can we reinterpret the role of business, to provide solid solutions to relevant problems?</p>
<img src="/static/media/unique-flavour.b9eb31ba.jpg" alt="Luker brand">
<p>At Luker Chocolate we firmly believe that companies have perhaps the most powerful capacity to offer real and scalable solutions to pressing and urgent problems. We also believe that it is important to share experiences and lessons learnt. We have a certain optimism and celebrate alongside an increasingly large group of companies around the world who have been encouraged to understand business as a tool for change. These include existing companies, as well as the strong wave of new social entrepreneurs who we should encourage, help, and empower.</p>
<p>At Luker Chocolate, over the past 113 years, we have been sensitive to trying to help different communities, essentially thanks to a set of values ​​inherited across five generations. Throughout our history, we have tried different approaches, from philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, to social work by the Luker Foundation on education and entrepreneurship issues. For some years, we have been evolving that interest to try to incorporate the idea of ​​shared value at the heart of the business strategy. I have to say that it has not been easy, or fast. It is not a clear or simple path, especially as this is a business that is already up and running, and so this implies the rethinking of multiple activities as we go along. One of the most complex challenges that we are looking at today has to do precisely with measuring social impact and its correlation with the creation of economic value for the company. However, despite the challenges and demands, and although there are many elements that are still under construction, from my professional experience it has been a wonderful journey. We have followed a path that has allowed us to innovate and visualize new ways in which our operation and business model can positively impact society. The journey has been rewarding in its humanity.</p>
<p>Along our journey, we have been able to stop to reflect and explore our industry’s most complex problems, namely, the way the cocoa-producing territories in Colombia where we work have been marked by historical violence, drugs, illegality, poverty, lack of opportunities, and lack of infrastructure and education, among many others. Seeing these problems from the perspective of shared value has led us to innovate, to try to solve things. And it is innovation that is an indispensable tool for the incorporation of shared value into a strategy. Innovation represents an absolute priority when trying to solve complex social problems and, at the same time, create economic value. Given that these adverse conditions are unchartered territory, it is experimentation that allows us to learn and deal with the different challenges. All the efforts will start to make sense only when we begin to see the tangible social results.</p>
<p>At Luker Chocolate, we provide chocolate as an ingredient for industry and we manufacture finished products for other brands around the world. Our clients range from small artisanal chocolatiers to large industries, from entrepreneurs who are launching new brands to large, well-established retailers. They all have three things in common: a marked interest in and a commitment to supporting social and environmental impacts, an entrepreneurial mindset that looks for innovation, and a clear priority for superior flavour and quality. As a B4B (Business for business) company, at Luker Chocolate we say that our mission is to help other companies create purpose-driven chocolate products. Our clients are mostly active protagonists of The Chocolate Dream, our long-term vision to transform the cocoa regions where we operate. There are several ways in which we visualize our alignment with the purpose of our clients and how we can help them to strengthen their brands and business models:</p>
<h3>A CONNECTION TO THE ORIGIN THROUGH IMPACT PROJECTS</h3>
<p>Alongside our clients, we co-create social impact projects in the different cocoa regions and for the communities that are part of our own cocoa forests. We jointly invest in education, entrepreneurship, art and culture, and the environment. We are committed to improving rural economic diversification along different axes such as tourism and other market initiatives with a view to building prosperity and strengthening regions’ competitiveness. Through this approach, our clients also build connections by committing to the unknown, with innovative experimental projects that allow us to create new knowledge together. In these projects, we can also help our clients to design unique strategies on how to connect their consumers with their impact, improving their brand equity through emotional and meaningful connections.</p>
<h3>THE COCOHABS, OUR CENTRE FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>
<p>This space is dedicated to hosting people who voluntarily come from all over the world to give their time and knowledge to support the local communities, rural entrepreneurs, and to generate solutions to real problems in the area. The aim of this space is to open the doors to different disciplines to enhance our insight into social innovation. Our customers, their consumers, our suppliers, and allies are welcome to pursue this unique experience.</p>
<h3>IMPACT THROUGH NEW PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>As well as tasting unique from being made from 100% Cacao Fino de Aroma, many of our new product developments are being conceptualized and designed with a social mission in mind: from sugar-free chocolates enhanced with fibre and proteins to contribute to healthy diets, to much more sophisticated formulations with functional ingredients that seek specific improvements in nutrition, given the powerful antioxidant capability of cocoa. We are always reviewing multiple ingredients that can accompany our chocolates to enhance their ability to improve health, whilst keeping their indulgent quality. Our strength is based on single origin dark chocolates. Vegan chocolates and other health-conscious concepts are a permanent part of our exploration and input into creating products aimed at improving people’s health through what they eat and how they indulge. Sustainable packaging and environment impact are a central part of our products.</p>
<p>These are only 3 of the many other initiatives where we can help infuse a brand with purpose. Purpose must be discovered, visualized, and encouraged to be incorporated at the forefront of our venture. We dream of helping to create, together with our customers, an inspiring industry, where we use chocolate as a tool for change. An industry where people are placed at the centre of the conversation and where collaboration is at the heart of our efforts.</p>
<p>Do you want to discover our delicious fine flavour chocolates? Let’s first talk about the impact you want to create in the world.</p>

      content: `<p>No, it is not a song. Nor is it a declaration of love. It is a momentous search that I carried out over the last two years for the solution to the most brutal professional challenge that I have come up against. Let me tell you all about it…</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate is a company with over 113 years of history. However, just 10 years ago, we decided to internationalize and take our chocolate across the globe. With our hopes set on this goal, we realized that we had to face new challenges. Selling chocolate to industry and manufacturing final products for other companies is a business that has nothing to do with what we have done for 100 years in Colombia; serving companies instead of end consumers and selling in 42 countries rather than just one, are completely different challenges.</p>
<p>So when I took on the role of director of manufacturing and subsequently vice president of the supply chain at Luker Chocolate, I was assigned, alongside my team, the mission of drastically raising the level of production fulfilment, satisfying the service guarantee for our customers, stabilizing production costs and designing the expansion plan for the production plant and logistics warehouses, considering the new international market we were facing.</p>
<p>How could we achieve this? “Increase the efficiency of industrial and logistics operations, regulate inventories and reach the level of service promised to your customers”: voilà you are a COO (Chief Operations Officer) 10/10. Surely you will also have a good cost performance, healthy working capital and, of course, happy customers. More applause, you are the Messi of operations management.</p>
<p>And what happens if one day this formula fails? What happens when traditional methods do not suffice? What happens when your supply chain does not react to the classic engineering stimuli in all of its different iterations? Welcome to my world.</p>
<p>I have been immersed in industrial operations for 11 years: many hours of sweat, as many of tears, and few of sleep. An engineering degree, two masters, several diplomas. And all for what? To understand that in the end, we are so infinitely vulnerable, that regardless of everything you know, a machine will have technical problems, the production plant is going to stop and no matter the number of supply and distribution statistical models, someday your customer will end up without your product. We are human, and we are not perfect; we cannot be arrogant enough to think that everything we do is fail-safe.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what has always kept me standing and looking towards the future: the capacity for transformation of the human spirit. Take my word for it, this is the energy that fills me up every day, that inspires me to see through other people’s eyes, that fills me with happiness on seeing how raw materials become a  with a history that can change someone’s day and make them smile.</p>
<h3>THE SPIRIT: A NEW FACTOR IN THE EQUATION</h3>
<p>It was precisely by means of that spirit that I began to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It was clear that innovation in the new model for the Luker Chocolate supply chain had little or nothing to do with numbers, statistical models and continuous improvement methodologies. It was about innovation in productivity from a human and non-technical point of view. It was a blow against a fortified barrier from an unarmoured warrior; it was the spark I was looking for.</p>
<p>We had to get to work on the task of designing the operation strategy for the entire Luker Chocolate supply chain, and it needed to be fast, effective, but, above all, genuine. It had to be ambitious, we had to dream big, we needed to aim for the stars. What would be expected of a strategy proposal that a whole team of engineers had worked on? What was the result? Raising our people’s spirits. But that was the way it was, we had taken on an enormous task, everybody in the production plants, in the distribution centres and in the administrative offices had to be connected body and soul to our purpose.</p>
<p>We gave up prioritizing production costs and customer service levels; we had to attend to ourselves first.</p>
<h3>SOMETHING HAD TO STICK</h3>
<p>The first step was clear; we had to create an identity. To do this, we initially focused on manufacturing and communicating the three rules of the game ad infinitum: participatory leadership, two-way communication, and leaving a mark.</p>
<p>Participatory leadership meant delegating workload, it was a way of asking for help from the entire team and telling them that the more people who rowed the boat, the faster it would go. It meant empowering, letting go, accompanying and encouraging. Encouraging and supporting. Less Messis, more teams. Remember that we are vulnerable and we will always need help.</p>
<p>Two-way communication was not understood to be any different from situations where Directors and Bosses would initiate conversations with their collaborators, or those where the collaborators would take the initiative. Hierarchies are mental, but respect and dialogue are universal. Here the focus was to train ourselves in how to talk. A rather funny anecdote came out of this: my office was nicknamed The Doctor’s Office, as normally from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. conversations arose between collaborators, people who just wanted to dream and improve their way of doing things, but needed the wings to do it.</p>
<p>Leaving a mark was what the plant workers were achieving with their work; only they did not know it. Behind their effort was a higher purpose that started with The Chocolate Dream and that finally matured in our chocolate becoming a tool for change.</p>
<p>We had valuable conversations with our people, we were sensitive, empathetic and we opened our doors, because we needed to become obsessed with sensing that positive energy flowed in the production plant, I became obsessed with seeing the day when people would look us in the eye when we talked to them. We listened to the market and applied consumer knowledge techniques, but this time the market was our plant and the consumer each of our white-overalled soldiers who give it their all to really make our chocolate a tool for change.</p>
<h3>A CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES, THE REDESIGN OF OPERATIONS AND TECHNICAL RIGOUR</h3>
<p>The rules of the game that I talked about earlier were not enough to overcome the challenge. When it comes to people, we have to rethink methods and technology so that everything progresses in the most harmonious and balanced way possible; management based only on the technical aspects and with soft skills is like food without salt.</p>
<p>At this point, it was necessary to enlist the entire technical arsenal of operations management to bring changes in methods and technology to the table.</p>
<p>Regarding the methods, among other things, an aggressive plan to increase efficiency was launched, a plan that had three characteristics: it was practical, easy to understand and very, very technical. Secondly, and perhaps most significantly, was the change in the production plant administration’s entire organizational structure. If we wanted participatory leadership, two-way communication and for our people to leave their mark, the administrative structure should be prepared to manage these practices.</p>
<p>In technological terms, the Master Plan for Industrial and Logistics Operations was formulated with the objective of doubling the chocolate production capacity and preparing the company’s 5-year technological development path. An 18-month plan was launched; today we only have four months of it left.</p>
<h3>THE LAST DROP MAKES THE CUP RUN OVER</h3>
<p>Indeed. If you hammer enough, one of the nails must go in. Surprisingly, like an avalanche, the entire manufacturing system began to react, the level of customer service began to improve, inventories began to regulate themselves, production costs stabilized and people began to smile. As the cherry on the cake, 7 months after the launch of this strategy, the plant achieved record production. Not even in my wildest dreams would I have thought that this was possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best future planning is achieved by looking to the past, and Luker Chocolate’s past and present are imbued with closeness and familiarity, as principles that are tied to our history. We just needed to embrace these two elements and push them forward in a transparent and genuine way, because that is how principles and values should be treated, they can never be used like pawns in a game of chess.</p>
<p>If you ask me what the innovative element of this story is, I would tell you that it was in taking people out of the classic resource analysis – industrial engineers will know what I mean -. For us, people are not and will never be seen as a resource, they will always be people.</p>
<p>And how are we doing today? There is still a long way to go, there are so many things that can be improved and, most importantly, there are still conversations to be had. But the journey is more pleasant when small triumphs are celebrated.</p>
<p>Never forget that “everything burns if you apply enough spark.”</p>
<p>I present to you the people who worked this magic:</p>

      cover: 'banner-julio.jpg',
      date: 'JULY 2019',
      content: `<p>This series is based on the experience of three of our collaborators who went to Huila to live and work as cocoa farmers. In this first story, José Maldonado, Sustainable Supply Analyst, tells us about his experience.</p>
<p>From a very young age, the countryside and I have been inseparable. My paternal grandfather is a veterinarian and has been a milk producer all his life, while my maternal grandfather is a coffee farmer, as were his ancestors for several generations. I’ve always been proud of the Colombian countryside and I’ve identified myself as part of it, so much so that I have often told people that I am from the countryside with my head held high.</p>
<p>I thought I had a lot of experience, but after spending two weeks accompanying different cocoa farming families in Huila, I realized I couldn’t be more in the wrong. To be from the countryside requires courage and sacrifice, but above all, you need to have a giant heart and be deeply in love with the land and its traditions.</p>
<p>On this journey, I met many people, but the stories that I am going to tell below belong to people who taught me great life lessons.</p>
<p>The first was Pedro Nel Córdoba; he met us at the Neiva airport and welcomed us. This Opita with his sung accent is the representative of Luker Chocolate’s Agricultural Development department for Huila, Tolima, Putumayo and Caquetá. There is no supplier, farm or association where he is not greeted with a big hug and like a brother returning home. Pedro knows and understands his land perfectly, because, full of pride, he often recalls that he grew up in the countryside and that his parents raised him and 5 brothers with the produce of 1 hectare of cocoa. He knows what it means to fight and work for a farm that, no matter how small, is the essence and source of life that sustains thousands of farmer families in Colombia.</p>
<p>The team led by Pedro was ready to embark on our 2-week journey through this beautiful department. We started in the municipality of Rivera, where we visited three families belonging to the Association of Cocoa Producers of the Municipality of Rivera (ASOPROCAR). I was fortunate enough to visit Doña Carmen’s farm, an 82-year-old woman, but with the heart and soul of a 20-year old. She is the matron of her family and is proud to be the head of four generations, but even more so, to see her children succeeding thanks to the life and education she was able to give them with the 3 hectares of cocoa that she worked on for so many years with her late husband.</p>
<p>Doña Carmen’s house is right next to her cocoa plantation. It is a home full of love and particulars; it is full of Catholic images and photographs with her family. During the visit, we toured all of her plantation and, plant by plant, this woman showed us how hard she works for her cocoa trees and how well she knows them.</p>
<p>The following day was revelatory, as it was time to harvest and shell the cocoa pods. Two workers were in charge of collecting them and there was also a shelling team, which we were part of. What seemed like a simple task turned out to be exhausting. In an hour, I had to stop twice, stand up, stretch and wait for my back pain to pass. Meanwhile, Doña Carmen, 82, did not complain once and only stopped for lunch. She just laughed when she saw us struggling to complete the task. That’s how I learned about the admirable strength and character of the people of Huila.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the neighbouring municipality of Campoalegre, the rice capital of Huila. A region with an agricultural vocation, marked by beautiful valleys with different types of crops. In this place, I was particularly marked by a farm in a mountainous area, where coffee is beginning to predominate. There we met Doña Concha, her son Gentil, and the person who would give me a great life lesson: Samuel. This more or less 35-year-old dark-skinned man, with a well-groomed moustache and an infectious joy, has his own corn and coriander crop on the farm and was one of our guides.</p>
<p>Samuel has been blind for 8 years, but we could not believe it, and it was not because we doubted his word, but because of the way in which he finds his way around the farm. He never gets lost and even walks very dangerous roads all by himself. The most incredible thing about this man is his attitude. At one point, he was asked if it had been very difficult to regain his life after losing his sight, and he quietly replied, “Only a little”.</p>
<p>After touring Huila, we set out on a road of about 86 kilometres to the south of the department. We travelled along the banks of the Magdalena River and the giant Quimbo Dam until our last destination: Garzón. This municipality is an important coffee-growing centre in Colombia and a great agricultural pantry for the region. It has also become a very important cocoa collection point for Luker Chocolate. This is where I had the most significant encounter and perhaps the one that inspired me the most to continue to work for the cocoa farmers of Colombia.</p>
<p>On the penultimate day of our journey, we went to the Majo trail to visit Don Ismael’s farm. Don Ismael is approximately 80 years old and native of the region. Our main host was “Chucho”, one of his sons who takes care of him and helps him with the work on the cocoa plantation. We had the opportunity to help them during the working day by collecting the ripe cocoa cobs throughout the morning. It wasn’t until the end of the day, and after enjoying a nice sancocho, that the character that influenced me immensely arrived.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old boy, redheaded and full of freckles, came in from the back door. He wore knee-length jeans, a white vest, a slingshot across his chest, and rubber boots. He brought a bucket full of small fish he had just caught in a nearby river. He looked like a Colombian Tom Sawyer, an adventurous child; one of those that are in danger of extinction. Without thinking about it, he approached us to show us the catch of the day and began to talk to us about everything he did after school. His name is Wilmer and he’s Don Ismael’s grandson. He took me on a tour to show me his onion crop, some ducks he is raising, and finally, full of pride, he showed me his own cocoa tree. A thought came into my head: “the Colombian countryside does have a great future and it is because of children like him that we must continue to work”.</p>
<p>Wilmer is an enterprising and curious child. At a very early age, he began to help his mother, as their father left them when he was just a baby. But this never stopped him. His way of seeing life, of appreciating agriculture, his desire to get ahead and the way he helps his family, marked me in an indescribable way.</p>

      title: 'CACAO FINO DE AROMA: COLOMBIA’S CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL HERITAGE',
      cover: 'banner-cacaos.jpg',
      date: 'JULY 2019',
      content: `<p>Today, after having developed a success story around Colombian Cacao Fino de Aroma throughout the world, and opening a market not only for Luker Chocolate but for all the country’s cocoa farmers, we want to go back and think about the road traveled, analyse the present, and think about what will come next.</p>
<p>One of our most important advantages, which has been difficult to replicate by other companies in the world, is our ability -developed over more than 100 years- to play with the different types of cocoa available to maintain consistency in the taste of chocolate, day after day and year after year, so that our customers can always enjoy the very best Colombian chocolate. To make drinking chocolate like Luker Tradicional, one of the products in our Colombian portfolio that is made 100% of cocoa liquor, and to ensure that it maintains its flavour through the years, is something that is still difficult to believe by many of our competitors, who know that the flavour of cocoa changes slightly in each harvest.</p>
<p>To tell you how we have achieved this consistent flavour, we must go back to 2004 – 2005, where we see Luker Chocolate as a local company beginning to think about the world and about the right strategy to internationalize as a global business. It was then that we began to deepen our knowledge of Colombian cocoa of which we already had the flavour identified and standardised according to the country’s main regions, and we sought the help of CENICAFE to conduct a scientific study to allow us to design a strategy based on the flavour of the cocoa and our ability to develop mixtures that preserve the flavour that we were promising.</p>
<p>In these first phases of our international business, it was scientifically proven that the cocoa from Santander, Tumaco, and Huila had the flavour characteristics necessary to define origin cocoa with its own personality and sufficient differentiation and volume to build an international expansion strategy. At the same time, we realized that there was an organization called ICCO (International Cocoa Organization), which had a clear definition for special cocoas, known as CACAO FINO DE AROMA. This is a cocoa free of taste defects, with a complex sensory profile that reflects not only the experience of those harvest it, but also the environment where it was grown, fermented and dried. A Cacao Fino de Aroma that has these criteria, also offers an important genetic diversity, as well as a historical and cultural heritage, and this was exactly what we believed of our Colombian cocoa; a cocoa that reflects the work of our country’s farmers, showing their culture and history, and that stands as a symbol of economic development and social transformation in the Colombian countryside. The difference is that it was beginning to be recognized worldwide.</p>
<p>At that time, one way to demonstrate that the cocoa was indeed Fino de Aroma was through the theobromine/caffeine ratio, which was used as a discerning factor to differentiate between Forastero, Trinitario and Criollo Cocoa (the first one being related to common cocoa and the latter to special cocoa) by discerning between their aroma and taste characteristics. It is worth specifying that while the level of theobromine is similar in all cocoas, the more Latin American in origin the cocoa, the higher the caffeine.</p>
<p>All these antecedents, organized by a team of visionaries determined to do something different, allowed us to design and implement an expansion strategy based on the flavour of Cacao Fino de Aroma, sustained by years of experience in chocolate making, deep agricultural knowledge developed on the Luker Chocolate Granja, and a strong relationship with small cocoa farmers in our country.</p>
<p>In these 15 years of history, we have increased our scientific knowledge of our Cacao Fino de Aroma, we have developed new origins and more are on the way. We can now clearly define the physicochemical characteristics of cocoa from some 40 regions of the country. Technical parameters such as vitamin and mineral content, antioxidants and polyphenols, structure of triglycerides present or theobromine/caffeine ratio, is information that can be used for the design of almost any type of chocolate that our customers require, always preserving the flavour characteristics that we can control. We continue to maintain our ability to manufacture the drinking chocolate that Colombian consumers like, while also developing a portfolio of chocolates for the world’s professional market. More than 100 recipes or mixtures of cocoa and other ingredients enable us to have an unsurpassable offer of chocolates made with Cacao Fino de Aroma.</p>
<p>The list of countries that export Cacao Fino de Aroma total or partially is made up today of 25 countries according to the decision made by the panel of experts at the last ICCO meeting in Abidjan on April 13, 2019. The panel of experts is made up of 10 people, 5 from non-producer countries and 5 from producer countries, of which we are part, and is responsible for recommending to the ICCO, the qualification to be given based on the guidelines established in the International Cocoa Agreement. According to historical information, the list of countries was reviewed in the years 1972, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1993, 2001, 2010, 2015 and 2019.  Colombia appeared as a partial exporter of Cacao Fino de Aroma in 1993. In 2008, it was included by the panel in the list of countries with 100% compliance, and in 2010 this was raised to 95%, a figure that has been maintained ever since.</p>
<p>We are delving deeper into the world of flavour, developing new varieties of cocoa that offer very interesting profiles, while increasing the productivity of our crops and the cocoa regions where we work. We are exploring new technologies that will allow us to perfect and standardize the fermentation and drying processes, in order to continue to offer the best chocolates made with Colombian Cacao Fino de Aroma to the whole world.</p>

      content: `<p>In The Chocolate Dream, we believe that to fulfill a dream, the union of many is required, and we firmly believe in art and culture as detonators of development.</p>
<p>This is the story of our first volunteering, a tale where art and teamwork were integrated to take the first step —of many we have given so far—intending to generate development in one of the cocoa regions where we work.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-9.c4af0582.jpg" alt="Pinta caribia men">
<p>Our cocoa forest in Necoclí employs people from nearby towns, full of passion and eager to master the cultivation of cocoa, provide for their families and lead the progress of their communities. Among our cocoa farmers, we have 70 workers from Caribia, a small village that is part of the subregion of Urabá, Antioquia, Colombia.</p>
<p>For some time now, its inhabitants began to train as technicians in sustainable tourism and voiced their enthusiasm towards turning their village into a touristic destination, taking advantage of its historical wealth —it was the first settlement in the area and had a tremendous ethnic diversity—. This was an excellent opportunity to support the Caribia community by helping them spread to the world the energy and generosity their people carry in their hearts, and their relentless desire to move forward. We were thrilled to display that inner beauty into the community, by transforming Caribia into a vibrant touristic destination. With this grand challenge on our hands, Luker Chocolate recruited happy volunteers to paint the Caribia dream in colors, and this is how Pinta Caribia was born.</p>
<p>For us Pinta Caribia is more than just an initiative, it is the tangible metaphor and magical realism that exists around the cocoa pod, that not only nurtures the beans but also nurtures lives and builds dreams around it.  With our hearts filled with empathy and lots of excitement, the sustainability team of The Chocolate Dream started to materialize the execution of Pinta Caribia.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-7.4768f7ff.jpg" alt="Pinta caribean girls">
<p>This is how we got in touch with the Orbis-Pintuco Foundation (organization with experience generating development through education and color in vulnerable populations throughout Colombia) and together we saw the potential of doing an artistic day in which volunteers from Luker Chocolate and inhabitants of Caribia would paint as a team until the last house of the village.</p>
<p>The Orbis-Pintuco Foundation helped us to create a program in which 20 young people from Caribia applied to be trained as technicians in painting. Now we only needed the materials, because we had to collect 500 gallons of paint. Between the Orbis Pintuco Foundation, Luker Chocolate and its collaborators, we collected donations to reach the goal. Additionally, 30 of our collaborators, including the management committee, travelled as volunteers to participate in Pinta Caribia, the name we decided to put on this initiative and work shoulder to shoulder with the workers of our farm.</p>
<h3>PAINTING A DREAM</h3>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-8.b85e34a1.jpg" alt="Girl painting">
<p>And the big day finally arrived, on June 22nd, more than 30 volunteers and Caribans united their efforts around the dream of turning Caribia into the most colorful place in Necoclí. The palette was carefully selected to represent the colors found in the cultivation of cocoa, colors that for the Caribia population have a deep meaning: blue symbolizing tranquility, green representing the peace found in the village, yellow representing the prosperity achieved in the cocoa fields and red for the love they have for their community and families.</p>
<p>Each volunteer helped two families to paint their houses while receiving assistance from the inhabitants who had previously been trained by the Orbis-Pintuco Foundation. Also, the community was responsible for preparing breakfast, lunch and food, thus concretizing great teamwork and strengthening the links between Luker Chocolate and the community.</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder, despite the heat and exhaustion, we worked for a common goal and this effort was reflected in the results: 100 houses were painted that day, from the primary school, community center, nursery, to the playgrounds.</p>
<img src="/static/media/growing-comunity.598f55e2.jpg" alt="Cocoa community">
<p>The Chocolate Dream colors covered more than 100 houses in the small town, and these colors tell the story of how dreaming together and working together can make dreams a beautiful reality. Today we want to thank the community of Caribia for allowing us to connect with their dreams, open the doors of their homes and let us fill their lives with color and chocolate; without a doubt, they also painted our hearts. </p>

We pray for those who do not have enough to eat, for the sick, for prisoners, and the kidnapped. We thank you for the opportunity to meet here today and for the presence of these doctors and engineers who have come to help us progress, to improve our countryside, our farms, and our lives. Amen</q>.  Prayer of Don Jesús, cocoa farmer in Huila.
<p>Standing with his eyes closed, and holding hands with the people around him, this was the prayer that Jesus Augusto Gomez uttered aloud before inviting us to the table. The chicken sancocho had been prepared on a wood-burning stove as you could tell by its smoky taste, by the smell of wood in the air, and by the smoke blowing out from Doña Elvira Quintero de Gómez roof. The table was laid with a classic hand-woven tablecloth, very typical of Colombian peasant houses, with plates from different sets collected over the years and cutlery of different styles and shapes. The soup, the main course and a delicious agua de panela were arranged in each one of the 8 carefully placed spaces at Doña Elvira’s wooden table. In total, there were 11 of us, so after the prayer, Don Jesus, his wife Doña Elvira, and their son “El Mono”, moved to let the guests sit down and have lunch first. He said we were the priority. In spite of having worked all morning on his farm harvesting cocoa under the Huila sun (Colombia), and at the age of 75, he refused to sit down as a gesture of hospitality.</p>
<p>The four of us from Bogotá were, in fact, complete strangers to this cocoa family. We had asked the associations ASOPROCAR and ASOPECA to take us to visit a farm in the region, because we wanted to learn about their reality, live in their environment for a few hours, and spend time with them for no other reason than to listen to what they had to tell us.</p>
<p>I have to confess that when we arrived in Huila, I had no clear idea of how they were going to receive us. I thought that our visit would make them suspicious because it’s not a common thing to do. We had arrived suddenly hoping to get into a family’s personal space for an entire day in exchange for nothing. I thought they would refuse to receive us or ask us what we were really there for. What would happen if you suddenly arrive at a house in Bogotá and asked to stay there all day? To my surprise, we were greeted with a big smile and a contagious kindness.</p>
<p>After a short conversation to welcome us and to show us around the place, we went out into the 3-hectare cocoa plantation with very tall, old trees, with thick trunks, a typical characteristic of the area’s very traditional agriculture and practices. Don Jesus was walking with some difficulty, as he had an accident when he was young that injured his leg. He didn’t complain, but we could see that it was difficult for him to walk. He then told us that he had had five strokes, but that he was still working as usual. During the tour, he spontaneously told us anecdotes about his life. To the left of the path where we walked, there was a ravine with crystalline water, with huge stones and leafy vegetation. The shade of the cocoa trees and the sound of the ravine made for a cosy atmosphere that served as the backdrop for a conversation of about 2 hours. We learned about how Don Jesus managed his estate. Although he did not know for sure how much he produced, nor did he have any figures written down, he knew his trees like the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>After lunch where we were treated with so much hospitality, we spent time with the family who taught us how to prepare guarapo, a typical Colombian drink made with sugar cane juice. In the courtyard, they had an old cane-chopping machine. “El Mono” had already cut some of these plants that were ready to be put through the machine to extract the juice. We all helped, and in the end, obtained about 5 liters of guarapo. Tired out by the afternoon activity, we went to the kiosk where Don Orlando, leader of the cocoa association, who works with Don Jesus, invited for a brandy after dinner.</p>
<p>At the kiosk, Don Jesus told us more stories about his life, one of them about his leg accident. He told us that at the age of 20, he was chasing a girl he liked. One night, he wanted to go out on his horse to look for her. His mother warned him not to go out, that it was too late and that it was not the right thing to do. He went out anyway and fell from his horse, which almost left him disabled. The moral he had to share with us, in the end, was: “A mother always knows what’s best for you. Always listen to your parents”. Just then, Guillermo Valderrama, our 65-year-old-consultant, added, “That’s right, he who doesn’t listen to his mother, doesn’t listen to God’s voice”.</p>
<p>He also told us about how he had stopped drinking alcohol in his old age, thus losing many of his friends. He told us about his childhood secrets and his indelible memories of the era of bipartisan violence between liberals and conservatives – two Colombian political parties – during the 1950s. He told us how he saw many people die near the farm where he grew up and about the recent violence. At 75, he recounted these memories as if they had happened yesterday. His trauma was evident, but his conviction for the value of work, the countryside, agriculture, and peaceful community life was also strong.</p>
<p>As we were about to leave, “El Mono”, who had a mental disorder due to having drunk adulterated alcohol and who had been feeling depressed and lonely lately, told us: “thanks to your visit, my farm looks even more beautiful to me today”. Today has been an amazing and happy day for me. I learned more things than on any other day in the Bogotá office; I spoke with more empathy; I was more at peace; more human; happier; I hugged people I had never seen before; I enjoyed the tranquillity of the countryside; I met people who, despite not having been able to finish high school, knew more than I did; I was once again aware of the value of our countryside and of the human quality and drive of our peasants.</p>
<p>At Luker Chocolate, we will continue to work with them and for them, because it is they who make it possible for us to enjoy the food the earth gives us.</p>
<p>Those two weeks I spent with cocoa farmers in Huila marked my life as very few other things had. Pedro, Doña Carmen, Samuel, and Wilmer made me see that life in the countryside is very different from what I had experienced; it is more challenging, yes, but just as it challenges the land also inspires passion. It reconnects you with your roots and makes you grateful for the little things in life. For this reason, I want to continue to work towards developing the Colombian countryside through cocoa; I want to dignify the life of the farmers of my country and, above all, I dream of the day when all farmer children can have a quality future, so that their dream is to stay and work in the countryside and change the reality of our country.</p>

      content: `<p>Enhancing the countryside and boosting Colombia’s cocoa-growing communities is the driving force behind El Efecto Cacao, an alliance between Luker Chocolate, Luker Foundation, USAID Colombia, Enel-Emgesa, Fundación Saldarriaga Concha and Universidad EAFIT, which works for the rural and inclusive development of cocoa-growing communities in Bajo Cauca, Urabá and South Centre of Huila.</p>
<img src="/static/media/el-efecto-cacao.bc6f7bc9.jpg" alt="Efecto Cacao">
<p>To make El Efecto Cacao a reality, the private and public sectors need to work hand in hand. The private sector has a long-term vision, greater stability in policies and strategies, capacity to generate value through the market, contacts with international volunteers, and, in our case, Luker Chocolate is inherently interested in cocoa producers, their families and their communities.</p>
<p>Through its Global Development Alliances (GDA) model, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provides effective assistance to developing countries through public-private partnerships. To execute this model, the country must demonstrate that it has private companies with the capacity to invest resources in community purposes, connecting solutions with economic activities that produce shared value. This is where all the actors in this alliance play a fundamental role.</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate and the Luker Foundation sought resources from USAID to contribute to The Chocolate Dream, a long-term vision for leading social and economic development in cocoa-producing regions. The Luker Foundation also provides a crosscutting focus on education and entrepreneurship. The initiative was backed by Universidad EAFIT with its experience in improving productive associations to generate development in rural territories; Fundación Saldarriaga Concha with the Universidad del Norte and its “ReHaSer” Program, which seeks to generate resilience skills in the most marginalized territories of the country; and Enel-Emgesa, which develops social and environmental projects in the area of influence of the Quimbo Dam.</p>
<h3>BUT HOW DOES EL EFECTO CACAO WORK?</h3>
<p>The focus of the agreement is on small-scale cocoa producers who while benefiting from a social and economic impact also bring stability to their family and community. We support small-scale cocoa producers, but with no sense of paternalism. The first commitment comes from the producers themselves who have to invest resources in their farms and implement all the necessary improvement practices. The total investment is 35 million dollars, donated by all the actors that are part of this alliance. The funds will be executed in the next 5 years, which is how long the project will run.</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate offers its business crops in Urabá and Huila as a model of inclusive rural development for producers to receive technical support, appropriate better technologies, and take advantage of distribution channels.</p>
<img src="/static/media/paint-window.40d79a05.jpg" alt="Painting window">
<p>The agreement provides all the tools that, from our experience with the cocoa-growing communities, we know are useful: training; agricultural extension; renovation pruning; transitory shade seeds; soil analysis; fertilizers; administrative, technical and commercial advice for the associations; support in entrepreneurship, formal education for children, youth and adults; psychological support; and, finally, institutional relationship to manage other sources of support according to the specific needs of the beneficiary population.</p>
<h3>WHERE ARE WE GOING?</h3>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-4.28b994d9.jpg" alt="Efecto Cacao People">
<p>Our goal is to increase the productivity of 1340 hectares of cocoa, strengthen 17 cocoa associations, accompany 20 entrepreneurial initiatives, and strengthen the academic and social-emotional skills of 1561 people.</p>
<p>We are convinced that this type of public-private partnership is a clear example of the scope of good cooperation practices and the great results that can be achieved when working hand in hand. Without doubt, El Efecto Cacao will change the lives of many families and serve as an example of rural development for the world.</p>
<p>We invite you to keep an eye on the project’s advances. Don’t forget to leave your comments below.</p>

      content: `<p>Before working at Luker Chocolate as a trainee at Granja Luker, our cocoa research and training center, I imagined that I would work in an office with white walls and full of computers, but I was very wrong.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Granja Luker, my welcome committee was made up of a pack of very grumpy dogs who wouldn’t let me in, because they, good guard dogs that they are, are in charge of keeping the farm safe. It was only after I managed to come in closer to them that they let me in so I could get to my new job. Without knowing it, one of the dogs -Peggy- would become my inseparable adventure companion. It was then that I realized that this was not a typical job because from then on my working days would be spent in the middle of a cocoa forest and my time shared with hundreds of different species.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-dog.e4e80138.jpg" alt="Cocoa friend Peggy">
<p>Plants, and crops in general, are known to harbor an immense number of insects and animals, but deforestation and the intensive use of monocultures have caused them either to migrate or to increase their populations disproportionately, to such an extent that they are considered pests. Forest plantations in Colombia have been used for commercial purposes and as strategic tools for the restoration of degraded soils and the conservation of water resources; however, the effect of forest plantations on local diversity has been insufficiently evaluated, especially in the role they play as habitats for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity (Haggar et al., 1997, Barlow et al., 2007, Mitra and Sheldon 1993). In the case of Luker Chocolate, we have implemented agroforestry systems both on Granja Luker and on our cocoa farms in Necoclí (550 ha) and Casanare (1,000 ha), thus promoting biodiversity and an optimal environment for the conservation of autochthonous fauna and flora.</p>
<p>But how do we measure the biodiversity we promote with our crops? Birds are used as an indicator of a region’s biodiversity because their abundance and occurrence is influenced by the characteristics and composition of the habitat with which they are associated, because they are relatively easy to observe, and they can be counted at large scales (GREGORY, 2006); RAMÍREZ-ALBORES AND RAMÍREZ-CEDILLO, 2002). Only in our cocoa forest in Necocli, there are 96 different bird species, almost 10% of the total number of birds reported in Colombia.</p>
<p>At Granja Luker, we measure biodiversity not only based on the presence of birds but also on the many other species that inhabit the crop’s ecosystem and that, in time, have become cocoa friends. Here are some of my most memorable anecdotes involving some of them.</p>
<p>On my first day of work, I decided to tour the farm with Peggy. As we walked, she started barking and frantically chasing after a group of birds. As I got closer, I realized that these animals were not in the cocoa field by chance; on the contrary, they were setting traps on the cocoa fruits to attract insects that would become their food.</p>
<p>Little by little, the day progressed, and it was soon time for lunch. In an ordinary office, lunchtime is usually a time to interact with our colleagues, and although that was what I was hoping for, it was not the case, since my colleagues were a little different. As I approached the dining room -to which the herd of dogs had come too- 1 km away from the main house, I came across chickens that were also looking for food, as well as a couple of hungry ducks and a parrot that shouted “quiere cacao?”.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-2.5bfa3000.jpg" alt="Cocoa friend parrot">
<p>A month later, I went to gather fruit with the farmworkers under a completely clear sky; the day was sunny, and I felt that nothing wrong could happen. But all of a sudden, I felt as though I was being electrocuted. I started screaming and the workers, used to such things, told me to take my shirt off because I was being stung by tiny wasps. I listened to them and managed to get rid of the insects, but then I decided to go back to see what had stung me, only to get stung again. I had been warned that in life one has both good and bad bosses, that some of them may even be moody, but I do not think that anyone has been so severely judged by a boss as I was by those wasps; surely that was their way of telling me that I had to be more respectful of their home.</p>
<p>The ecosystem at La Granja also includes some white worms that are colloquially called gusano pollo or chicken worms and that appear at certain times of the year. The first time I heard about them was when a farmer was pruning the trees, and one of these worms bit him and left him with a fever all day long. These animals are very common and go unnoticed as they feed on the leaves and live below them.</p>
<p>One day, everything was suddenly completely different. As we crossed a guadua bridge, we came across a small friend who could be terrifying for some people and fascinating for others: a snake found in some trees near a creek that crosses through the farm. When we saw it, I panicked and decided to move away a little, but it was used to seeing humans and didn’t get upset. One of the workers took it in his hands to take pictures of her, as it was one of the “pets” that belonged to the farm and, as they are often killed in the region, this one was being protected by the workers. After the photo was taken, the worker put it back in its den, while I recovered from the shock!</p>
<p>Finally, I will never forget the day when one of the workers saw something tiny moving in the bushes and decided to take a look. It was a baby squirrel that had lost its mother, so he took it to the farm, took care of it himself, and protected it from predators. In time, the squirrel decided to go its own way, but it often comes back to visit the worker that helped it as a baby, or to eat cocoa cobs!</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many species that live here and show how a cocoa crop can become a sanctuary for hundreds of coexisting vertebrate and invertebrate animals, from possums, armadillos, guatines, dogs, cats, ducks, rabbits, to snakes and insects. They have to be protected and cared for because they perform a task that is way more important than anything we can do: they maintain a balance of populations and the biodiversity of an entire ecosystem. While they do such an outstanding job, I, who remained working at Granja as an agricultural analyst, will continue to let them walk with me and fill my days with greater meaning.</p>

      content: `<p>Few people are aware of the great benefits of regular cocoa consumption; the vast majority of consumers are convinced (some by medical recommendations) that cocoa and/or chocolate are harmful to health. In order to solve this dispute, Luker Chocolate’s research area, in association with research centres in Colombia and Italy (University of Molise – Campo Basso, Sannio Tech – Benevento, and University of Brescia), characterised the cocoa from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and for over four years have developed a variety of experimental designs, including preclinical and clinical studies with 50 volunteers. Once the results were obtained, we discussed them with a group formed by the most renowned cardiologists, nutritionists, nutritionists, dermatologists, sportsmen, etc.</p>
<p>Today, we have enough scientific and technical evidence to be able to assert that regular consumption of cocoa helps to improve and protect people’s health. But how much chocolate should we consume? Our recommendation is two servings of chocolate powder a day or one of dark chocolate for at least one month. This will help you to:</p>
<h3>PROTECT YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH</h3>
<p>Consuming cocoa helps reduce total cholesterol and bad cholesterol (LDL), while increasing good cholesterol (HLD) and reducing or regulating the omega 6 and omega 3 ratio, helping to improve your heart health and decreasing the risks of such diseases. Your heart will become even stronger if, as well as consuming cocoa, you begin to acquire healthy lifestyle habits in your diet by decreasing the consumption of animal fats and carbs, while increasing your consumption of pulses and vegetables. We also recommend that you do some physical exercises such as walking up to 10,000 steps a day.</p>
<h3>PROTECT GASTRIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL HEALTH</h3>
<p>Cocoa contains fibre (insoluble and soluble) that helps to improve bowel movement and eliminate toxins from the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. These types of fibre have a prebiotic characteristic that feed probiotic microorganisms that maintain gastric health. It is important to remember that immune health is largely conditioned by gastric health; unfortunately many people have gastric problems due to the low intake of fibre from pulses and vegetables.</p>
<p>Tip: eat chocolate and vegetables daily, and you will notice how your gastric and immune health improves.</p>
<h3>IMPROVE YOUR MOOD</h3>
<p>Cocoa has molecules that act as neurotransmitters of messages in the central nervous system. One of these is phenylethylamine, better known as the molecule of love. It has been proven that the brain of a person in love contains large amounts of this substance that could be responsible for certain sensations such as excitement, tachycardia, and redness, among others. This neurotransmitter triggers the action of other neurotransmitters called happiness molecules such as serotonin (generates a feeling of self-love and respect for others), oxytocin (generates a feeling of love for others and affective bonding), and dopamine (generates joy and a feeling of euphoria).</p>
<p>Tip: don’t make life bitter, take it easy and drink chocolate, the antidepressant par excellence. It really works.</p>
<h3>PRODUCING OR ACTIVATING THE BODY’S ENERGY SYSTEMS</h3>
<p>Yes, consuming cocoa helps to produce energy or activate the existing energy in the body. Its potassium content and the activation of important proteins in the process of energy production, make cocoa a key morning food that will help you stay energised throughout the day.</p>
<p>Best of all, it doesn’t contain excessive doses of caffeine.</p>
<h3>MAINTAIN THE OVERALL HEALTH</h3>
<p>This looks like a phrase taken from a youtuber’s video. It seems incredible or a little daring to claim. Let me explain. When we breathe or expose ourselves to the sun, our body releases substances that oxidise it and that are very reactive and dangerous. They are called free radicals and are incomplete molecules that go looking around our body for electrons to attach to. These radicals are the cause of the vast majority of chronic non-communicable diseases that cause the most deaths in the world, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. Although our body produces its own antioxidants that quickly neutralise those free radicals or oxidising substances, stress, irregular mealtimes, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, and not exercising decrease the production of natural antioxidants and free radicals begin to take over. In other words, bad habits make us rusty! Fortunately there are foods like tea, grapes, blueberries and especially chocolate, which bring levels of antioxidants to the body preventing this from happening. In the specific case of cocoa, it has a substance called NFR2, which is a protein that reactivates the genes that produce our own antioxidant substances, further increasing the protection against chronic non-communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Cocoa also possesses significant quantities of minerals that promote the development of biological reactions, such as potassium, which plays a role in energy production and regulates the heart rate; calcium, which helps transmit nerve impulses as well as protecting against osteoporosis; iron, which helps fight anaemia; and zinc, which helps the immune system, the cognitive development of children and the maturation and maintenance of sexual activity over the years.</p>

      content: `<p><small><b>Editor’s note:</b> Last year, we worked with Transhuella in an artistic project that gathered painting and photography to recognise the cultural heritage of the surrounding communities of our cocoa forest in Necocli. From their experience, they built a book full of stories and, today, we bring you the first one.</small></p>
<q>Train people well so that they can leave, treat them well so that they won’t want to</q>
<small>– Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin</small>
<p></p>
<p>In our imaginary, Luker Chocolate, is without doubt the yellow packaging that contains the chocolate that we drink once we stop drinking our mothers’ milk.  Hot chocolate is served even in the hottest climates in Colombia and in every family it represents genuine love and gives rise to expressions such as “Oh”, “Goodness”, “It’s boiling”, when they burn themselves.</p>
<q>Nowhere is hot chocolate served as hot as it is in Colombia.</q>
<p>There is something at Luker Chocolate that goes that bit further. There is a story of tradition and success of innovation and belonging, a story of responsibility that only few know.</p>
<p>A company with a large portfolio of products, sufficient to supply everything that a home needs, to give life and colour to our corner shops. In Colombia, we don’t have to go very far to buy what we need and say hello to our neighbours on the way.</p>
<p>There is a star product with a unique flavour that hypnotises people in the several blocks surrounding the main offices in main cities such as Bogotá: the smell of COCOA.</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate has built the backbone of its social responsibility programme based on cocoa, a programme that has been recognised and praised globally.</p>
<p>Social responsibility or shared value are synonyms for tax exemption and marketing campaigns that show the friendly side of companies. This is what we perceive as common citizens, as an excuse for companies that, rather than helping those in their area of impact and giving back to society what they’ve achieved, are only interested in reducing their taxes.</p>
<p>However, at Transhuella we know that the majority want to do the right thing and act with a social conscience; the majority produce with the intention of giving back all that Colombian society and its land has given us.</p>
<p>This is why we have embarked on this task with those who are willing to open their doors to show what there is behind each of their products: the love and their commitment to their origin and their society.</p>
<p>Sustainable companies are about understanding that the workers, employees, raw material, and surroundings are as important as their owners.</p>
<p>Does social responsibility not imply involving other people to make them fall in love with the meaning behind an individual effort turned common cause? In society, responsibility is shared; we all have something to contribute.</p>
<p>To our surprise, there is a team behind this great brand thinking not about how to show society its contribution (beyond the daily energy their chocolate gives us) but rather, about how to have an impact on the lives of those who make the Chocolate Dream come true.</p>
<img src="/static/media/nina.9b48b347.jpg" alt="girl">
<p>Mother and daughter, Rosalba and Silvia, say that Luker Chocolate is synonymous to blessings and opportunities. Silvia works with Luker Chocolate, and Rosalba, despite not doing so, has felt a positive impact on the region since the arrival of the company that has taken up residence in their hearts. A company that embarked on developing its business hand-in-hand with the community that surrounds its cocoa plantations in Necoclí, and not only those who work with them directly.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the presence of Luker Chocolate has given this community life and has driven its dreams, even for those who are not directly related to the company.</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate takes risks when it builds the country; it is an example for the Colombian business sector.</p>
<p>It’s true that chocolate is celebrated around the world… But only a magical place can understand the importance of celebrating the fruit from which this food is produced, a sweet, a product with as many facets and uses as the variety in its colours.</p>
<p>Caribia has 438 inhabitants, 438 voices that sing at the Cocoa Festival’s dawn ceremony:</p>

<q>The Festival is coming, coming, it is coming. The harvest is growing, let’s celebrate<br>
It’s coming, the Festival’s coming. The families come together, each and every one.</q>
<p>The Cocoa Festival is another opportunity for commotion at Luker Chocolate. They work alongside the community, paint the children’s smiling faces, share a cup of hot chocolate and a bowl of stew, everyone participates equally; they bring a team of outgoing and sociable professionals to remind the community of Caribia that without them, the chocolate would not taste as good.</p>

      content: `<p>The concept of sustainability has been defined, and redefined, by many over the last decade. It is a subject everyone talks about: experts, non-experts, young people, adults, business people, and government officials. Some place special emphasis on environmental issues; others, on social, economic issues; and others still, on the relationships between all the components. There are great discussions about what it means, or rather, about the paths we must trace as a planet in order to be sustainable. Concepts, interests, cultures, etc. come up against each other, but we all seem to agree that it is a matter of temporariness. How do we meet today’s needs without compromising tomorrow’s? The United Nations managed to get the whole world to look in the same direction: the Sustainable Development Goals that marked out a path that we must follow as humanity in order to live with dignity, guaranteeing resources for future generations.</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS MANAGED TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD TO LOOK IN THE SAME DIRECTION: THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THAT MARKED OUT A PATH THAT WE MUST FOLLOW AS HUMANITY IN ORDER TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY, GUARANTEEING RESOURCES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.</p>
<p>However, although the objectives are now clearer, we still face the challenge of their implementation: who, when, where, and how much money is needed? The discussion then takes a nuance between the practical and the philosophical, between the higher purpose that we as humans have and the will to carry it out. Questions arise as to who should start, whether to start from the bottom or whether it is the responsibility of the leaders. There are more questions about sustainability than there are answers, and there is an especially relevant one: who are the most critical players in making it a reality?</p>
<p>This is where the very classic discussion between the public sector and the private sector and their role in all this appears. The approach to the role that each must play is preceded by an even more complicated one: is it possible to talk about sustainability in these sectors? In the public sector, for example, there are some limitations to the possibility of being sustainable. A few of them may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The periods of administration of the Executive Branch (four years) are insufficient for long-term projects to be developed in a sustained manner.</li>
<li>The overload of the country’s regulations does not allow for progress and flexibility in the execution of public resources in order to make them economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable.</li>
<li>Building on what has been built has not been a pillar of governance of the public sector so that each time we start again, and the projects are unable to reach their capacity for transformation.</li>
<li>Public policies, which are the tool that allows good practices to be maintained over time, are not executed rigorously. Their budget continues to depend on the scope that the incumbent wants to give them; thus, they can become invisible to the point of disappearing.</li>
<li>Regulation around environmental issues is still not rigorous enough, not even for the public sector itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The private sector is also limited in being fully responsible in its economic, environmental, and social sustainability practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technological development available to generate savings and efficiencies is still insufficient or in some cases, very costly.</li>
<li>There are difficulties in finding sustainable allies throughout the value chain that adapt to the needs of the sector.</li>
<li>The training of business leaders has not been focused on sustainability, which suggests a limit to the massive corporate changes that are required for their development.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can, therefore, be said that both sectors find significant limitations in the challenge of guaranteeing the resources of future generations and in acting in a fully environmentally and socially responsible manner. However, there is a possibility of reducing these limitations and instead of using the strengths of both sectors that have not been fully explored.</p>
<p>This possibility implies, first of all, deconstructing the idea that the sustainability of each sector can only be developed in isolation. Humanity cannot live in dignity in the future if each sector tugs at its own side and strives to generate transformations alone. The only way out is to connect, to network, to articulate and to come together as human beings, regardless of where we are.</p>
<p>The public sector cannot be sustainable without the private; the private sector cannot be sustainable without the public, but to this formula, I suggest adding two new fundamental actors: academia and the community, the other two major players.</p>
<p>It is only by aligning efforts between these sectors that it will be possible to speak of sustainability since each of them has unique, indispensable, and irreplaceable characteristics that end up being the key pieces for the construction of sustainable cities, countries, and planet.</p>
<p>To be able to work together, we must create systems, tools, methodologies, look for common ground and, fundamentally, before any development that allows articulation, we must, as human beings who compose these sectors, leave our ego to one side, leave our comfort zone, be willing to work with different people, break with the stereotypes of different sectors and think empathetically.</p>
<q>THE PUBLIC SECTOR CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE PRIVATE; THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE PUBLIC, BUT TO THIS FORMULA, I SUGGEST ADDING TWO NEW FUNDAMENTAL ACTORS: ACADEMIA AND THE COMMUNITY, THE OTHER TWO MAJOR PLAYERS.</q>
<p>This is already possible, efforts have already been made to make this happen, and there are already examples of successes. However, it is still on a small scale. The call is for us to think as one, to be able, for the first time, to give up everything we have been building around individuality so that we can maintain and continue to improve our country and our planet. We have already shown that the path of sectorisation has not resulted in us becoming more sustainable; it is time for us to choose to work together for all humanity. Time is running out.</p>

      content: `<p>On August 2, we participated in the Women Economic Forum Latin America, the largest global gathering of women entrepreneurs and leaders worldwide. We gave a talk in which we discussed how we are re-imagining the role of women in agriculture for the world. Participating in such spaces allows us to publicize the reality of the Colombian countryside by making visible the role of its farmers. It also allows us to turn our attention towards rurality and to generate awareness of the misinterpretation of farmers and the great challenge that agriculture currently faces.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-friends-1.09b69a29.jpg" alt="Women Forum">
<p>The importance of rethinking the future of agriculture not only in Colombia but in the world, is because of the threat to the sustainability of agriculture and food security. Young people are not finding the countryside attractive or prosperous; there is no motivation to work in this sector. According to the United Nations, by 2050, the world population will be 9700 billion, making it necessary to question how and who will supply the basic inputs for food. Agriculture has the capacity to increase the incomes of vulnerable populations more effectively than other sectors of the economy according to the World Bank and yet a large percentage of adults in poverty are farmers. We live in a country that is 94% rural, but young people are increasingly migrating to urban areas.</p>
<p>In the talk we gave, we wanted to bring an inclusive perspective, showing that we cannot understand farmer women until we understand the countryside. We brought together the visions of sustainability, agriculture and women, to show what we are doing with The Chocolate Dream, our long-term-vision to drive change in the cocoa regions where we work.</p>

<p><i>Don’t touch! You’ll curdle it!</i></p>
<p>Many times, when I have been meaning to help, I have been shooed out of the kitchen when I have taken hold of the beater to stir the hot chocolate.</p>
<p>All those mothers who make hot chocolate every morning with sacred hands so that their family sets out with the energy to face the day.</p>
<p>It is true what Colombian chef, Leonor Espinosa, said when talking about the Colombian woman’s role as caregiver: She sows, fishes, takes care of the garden, the children, the kitchen.</p>
<p>The hands of Colombian women tell many stories.</p>
<img src="/static/media/bannerhealing.ccd78673.jpg" alt="Girl hug">
<p>While we were talking, Rosalba opened the yellow packet of Luker Chocolate, which is imprinted on my memory, to make the hot chocolate.</p>
<p>It was about 35 degrees Celsius, with 100% humidity; hot chocolate was not the best thing to be drinking, but Colombian mother’s vast wisdom says that “heat drives out heat”.</p>
<p>I drank the hot chocolate and could not stop looking at Rosalba. There was something in her eyes that revealed a silent sadness, a pain that had taken hold of the soul; that same look that I’ve seen in someone close to me, where the light has gone out.</p>
<p>I started walking with her while she showed me Caribia and she told me a little about her story. We always tend to hide something, not out of fear, but so we avoid hurting others.</p>
<p>We were born in the middle of a war. In Colombia, there are millions of parents who have lost a child, several children, millions of lives that have been dispatched for no reason, that have been snuffed out before their time, or so it seems for us mortals, who do not understand life’s plans for us. Those of us who believe in God wonder why he calls them away so quickly.</p>
<p>We all have dreams that drive our lives along. Colombian mothers push their dreams to one side to follow those of their children and partners. “I want to finish building my house for my family”, Rosalba said. I refused to let the family’s dream be her own dream.</p>
<p>Juancho, her son, was going to make her dream of studying Pharmacy Management come true before he had an accident. When he died, her dream did too.</p>
<p>Her son died a year ago. Rosalba shut down…</p>
<p>For some reason, life brings us together… So, I could learn about the pain, and so she could have a friend to remind her that Juancho, in heaven or wherever souls go to rest, would want her to be happy, he would want Juanita, his daughter, to enjoy her grandmother. Her husband, her children, Fernando and Silvia; her grandchildren, Juan Carlos and Laurita, all miss that grandmother who was once the life and soul of the party and who used to bring joy to their home.</p>
<p>Rosalba’s story is replicated in millions of Colombian mothers; a pain that we can’t imagine but that we must accompany.</p>
<p>Today, at Transhuella, we keep Rosalba company every day, technology has made it possible for us to communicate, send photos back and forth, ferry her granddaughter from Medellín to Necoclí to spend a few days together. Rosalba has begun to smile and has accepted that her dream of being a Pharmacy Manager could come true after all.</p>
<p>Now Rosalba is setting up a business with friends from Caribia so she can own her own restaurant thanks to Luker Chocolate and its selfless work in the community.</p>
<p>Without Luker Chocolate, our mission to change the world would not be possible. We are achieving it, one life at a time.</p>

      title: 'THE CONCHING PROCESS',
      date: 'OCTOBER 2019',
      content: `<p>As consumers we hardly realize how much is done to a cocoa bean before it can be turned into a chocolate, but more than a mystical metamorphosis, this transformation brings nature, science and art together. In order to bring a chocolate couverture to life, fermented and dried cocoa beans are selected, winnowed, roasted, ground, mixed (with other ingredients), refined and finally conched, which is what we will deal within this article.</p>
<img src="/static/media/conching-process.cac06e80.jpg" alt="conching process">
    <p>The conching process was discovered in 1879 by the Swiss chocolate-maker Rudolph Lindt, who left a mixer containing chocolate running overnight by mistake, and realized that this changed its flavour and texture. The name of the equipment, the conche, is derived from the Latin word ‘shell’, as the traditional conche used in chocolate manufacture resembled a shell.</p>
<p>Nowadays the conching process is the final step in the manufacture of chocolate, whether its milk or dark, and it is an essential process that contributes to the development of viscosity, final texture, and especially flavour. In the chocolate-making process, in the industry, we talk about ‘cocoa solids’ as particles that carry all the colour, taste, and most of the nutritional value of a chocolate bar, but these particles also happen to have intense bitter and astringent notes, which are given by polyphenols or antioxidants in cocoa, and some other off-flavours such as acetic acid left over from the fermentation process.</p>
<p>This processing step, which consists mainly of mixing, shearing, and aeration of the chocolate mass at a certain temperature and for a certain amount of time that will be discussed further, is considered a critical step for two main reasons:</p>
<p>During conching, the tiny particles of solids (cocoa, sugar and milk if is the case) acquire a more uniform shape, to be coated evenly with cocoa butter (continuous phase), which is going to give the chocolate its viscosity, flow and textural properties and determine the way in which the finished product will melt smoothly in the mouth.</p>
<p>The conching process promotes flavour development through several factors such as time, temperature and the other ingredients in the recipe, but it also removes moisture and volatile off-flavours (short-chained volatile fatty acids and aldehydes) that are highly related with the origin and characteristics of the cocoa beans. This is one of the most relevant reasons for which the conching process at Luker Chocolate is different from other chocolate manufacturing companies.</p><p>Among the scientific community, different researchers put forward different opinions on how many phases there are in the conching process. Some researchers defined conching as a two-phase process. In the first stage known as dry-phase, the moisture level is reduced, some volatile acids like acetic acid caused by cocoa fermentation are removed, and the surfaces of all solid particles are covered with fat. In the second stage, called wet-phase, homogenous and paste-like fluid mass is obtained by adding more cocoa butter and emulsifiers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some say that this process has three phases, which we actually perform at Luker Chocolate, and that can be described as follows:</p>
<h3>1. DRY PHASE</h3>
<img src="/static/media/conchado-seco.c303fd51.jpg" alt="Dry phase">
<p>The chocolate mass is transferred from the refiner, generally as flakes, to be heated, mixed and aerated. The primary objective of this stage is to allow the evaporation of some of the volatile acids from cocoa liquor and the water originating from the chocolate components. The total concentration of acetic acid after the dry conching stage remains approximately constant as there is no free water that acts as a vapour carrier.</p>
<h3>2. PLASTIC PHASE</h3>
<img src="/static/media/conchado-plastico.196668e1.jpg" alt="Plastic phase">
<p>The mass which was mixed, sheared, heated and degassed enters this second phase that we call the ‘long step’, where flavour characteristics are developed through chemical reactions (Maillard reaction and Strecker’s degradation) given by the process’ time and temperature conditions, and because of major volatilisation of acetic acid due to cocoa fermentation. It is called ‘plastic’ because of the physical change that occur in the mass turning the flakes into a paste and becoming more liquid as the cocoa butter covers the solid particles. Time and temperature play a key role in this stage. The temperature in particular is more closely related to the type of chocolate being manufactured (dark, milk or white), while the time has to do with factors beyond the type of chocolate, where the quality and variety of beans used to produce the cocoa liquor are extremely relevant.</p>
<h3>3. LIQUID PHASE</h3>
<img src="/static/media/conchado-liquido.b89fdaad.jpg" alt="Liquid phase">
<p>This phase is the shortest and it is where the viscosity and flow properties undergo the last adjustments with the addition of cocoa butter and emulsifiers.</p>
<p>Stating the fact that the type of technology is extremely important (i.e., actual conching machinery designs are more efficient in terms of energy and time) in the conching process during the plastic phase, normally milk chocolates are conched at around 50°C to prevent the caramelisation of the product which occurs above this temperature with the consequent formation of lumps that will be perceived as sandiness in the mouth. Some dark chocolates, on the other hand, can be conched up to 90°C because of their more intense load of volatile by-products from fermentation. However conching time is a big discussion point at this stage, because it is here that the quality, type and the origin of the beans are going to play a determinant role.</p>
<p>Throughout the years,Luker Chocolate has built an extremely close relationship with the Colombian farmers, sharing knowledge and experience, in order to guarantee and maintain exceptional quality characteristics by the end of the fermentation and drying of the cocoa beans. With this, and considering that the Colombian ‘Fino de Aroma’ cocoa beans are naturally complex in their flavour profile with delicate fruity, floral, and herbal notes, we take great care in the application of temperature and conching time for every chocolate couverture we produce, so that we can deliver finished products to customers all around the world bringing our final consumer a different flavour experience.</p>
<p>Here at Luker Chocolate, with state-of-art technology and our Colombian Fine Flavour cocoa beans, our conching process ranges from 2 to 7 hours, and this time is what really makes us different in terms of processing conditions. Other companies around the world that manufacture chocolate couvertures, working with bulk cocoa beans can apply conching processes from 12 to 78 hours, due to the high levels of acetic acid and other compounds that can have a negative impact on the final flavour of the chocolate. This is a disadvantage in terms of production efficiency (costs and energy).</p>
<p>The conching process is a specific step during chocolate manufacturing, which is very important for enhancing the quality of the finished product. However, long heat treatment and high shear -required for the removal of undesirable volatile compounds and moisture- present disadvantages for production efficiency and cost.</p>
<p>With this information, the next time you eat chocolate, close your eyes, pay attention to texture as the chocolate melts in your mouth, take a slight breath of air to assess flavour, and remember that behind that complexity, the joint work of science and nature is the magic behind new sensory experiences.</p>

      content: `<q>“WE WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO DARED TO START A BUSINESS MODEL OF GROWING COCOA IN COLOMBIA USING CACAO FINO DE AROMA CLONES”</q>
<p>Eight years ago, we came to the conclusion that the country had a dispersed model of cocoa development, starting with small producers. Traditionally, the cultivation of cocoa in Colombia was an activity in which farmers used to be very poor; they did not have technological resources or administrative management and did not have the capacity to project their businesses in the medium or long-term.</p>
<p>We came up with a business development model that would stimulate small producers around cocoa. In 2010, Luker Chocolate opted to grow its own crops to help the company satisfy its own Cacao Fino de Aroma needs -without abandoning the relationships established with cocoa associations all over the country-, in order to promote demonstrative agroindustrial projects that would promote large-scale cocoa plantations to drive rural development. In the same year, the company found 550 hectares of land traditionally used for cattle farming in Necocli, Antioquia. It turned this land into its first agroindustrial plantation and the largest agro-productive plantation of varieties of Cacao Fino de Aroma in the country, designed as an agroforestry system (simultaneous and continuous integration of fruit trees and timber-yielding varieties with agricultural crops, which allow greater yields and avoid soil erosion and loss of biodiversity).</p>
<p>Today, the plantation provides employment for over 180 people (it previously employed only 5) and over 600,000 new trees have been planted, leading to high economic, social and environmental impact among neighbouring communities. Here, The Chocolate Dream, our long-term vision to drive change in the cocoa producing regions where we work, was born.</p>
<p>Luker Chocolate was the first company that dared to start a cocoa crop business model in Colombia, specifically, in the cultivation of Cacao Fino de Aroma. In the first place, this required an important change of mentality. This meant a move from having farms to having companies, adopting technology, training human capital, implementing transparent and efficient administrative processes, and, in general, looking at the business on a much larger scale. All this is intended to guarantee results for Luker Chocolate, but also to ensure its vertical integration and the traceability and quality of our cocoa. Additionally, this model radiates examples of good production practices, technological tools and investment models in the area for the producing regions. Likewise, it produces parallel productive initiatives, improves the conditions of the surrounding areas and increases the quality of life of the people who inhabit them. Finally, it has shown the country that it is possible to have profitable large-scale cocoa projects.</p>
<p>The first project was designed in Necoclí, a region that had been damaged by violence and very precarious health and nutrition conditions. It was this project that ended up giving life to The Chocolate Dream. One of the great problems that this country has had is that in the remote regions some infrastructure has been created, but no development has been generated. We have to offer an activity for people to stay in the region, to have something to live with. That is when bridges and roads make sense. In my opinion, the Luker Chocolate cocoa cultivation business model works because it is a motor of economic development. If you do not economically develop a region, the bridge and the community centre don’t work. If there is one factor that generates money and moves the economy, development in these regions becomes possible. That’s why The Chocolate Dream works in Necocli.</p>
<p>Necocli was the first of several projects that the company intends to plant, followed by a double-sized plantation in Casanare department, in a crop previously used for the production of oil palm. The Casanare project has 1000 hectares of cocoa in an agroforestry system with palm, which today has generated 500 formal jobs.</p>
<p>Likewise, the development of another anchor crop in the department of Huila is expected, as part of an initiative to promote the planting of cocoa in that department. The main objective of the anchor crop is to provide on-site support to farmers in the region as part of a large promotion program in which other inhabitants are invited to plant cocoa. The goal is to expand the cocoa crop in the region with 350 new hectares of cacao and 450 hectares of crop renovation in 6 municipalities, which would impact 375 families.</p>
<p>For me, it is a source of pride to know that this company is not afraid to undertake major projects, rather it has been a pioneer and example throughout the country for this very reason.</p>

      content: `<p>Taking a trip to Colombia and living the #LukerExperience has proved an eye-opening experience for Le Salon Du Chocolat owner Dawn Shrives. She’s returned from the visit with a new appreciation of chocolate production and full of ideas as to how her Chichester-based business can help support the work being done in the South American country.</p>
<p>Set up in 2004, Le Salon Du Chocolat is a chocolate studio where visitors can try their hand at themed workshops and parties. Dawn also gives talks and demonstrations to local organisations and schools.</p>
<p>But Dawn’s passion is the ‘quality’ of chocolate from its source of cacao beans to the finished product. She explained:</p>
<p>Particularly over the last 20 years as the demand for cocoa beans has increased, forcing the price upwards, many big chocolate brands that we have grown up to love are now using less cocoa and bulking their products out with cheaper alternative vegetable fats and wheat flour. Thus the finished products are described as ‘bars’ or ‘chocolate flavoured’ as is it no longer contains enough cocoa to be able to call it ‘chocolate’.</p>
<p>Artisan chocolatiers are going back to using chocolate that contains only the basic ingredients that are needed. The couverture (chocolate buttons), which I use in my workshops, are made in Belgium and are a blend of cacao beans generally from Africa which is the source of around 70% of all cacao beans harvested. However I also use couvertures made with cacao beans from other growing regions such as Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica and when made from a single origin rather than a blend, give the chocolate a unique taste specific to that region.</p>
<p>Dawn was one of 20 chocolatiers who travelled to Luker Chocolate, Colombia, on a trip to see for herself how cacao is cultivated, harvested and made into chocolate while learning how Luker is supporting their cocoa farmers, families and local communities. Luker, a family business set up in 1906, is a Colombian cocoa supplier and chocolate maker that believes cocoa production can deliver positive societal change: “We believe that chocolate makes the world a better place.” Luker Chocolate purchases almost 40% of the total cacao produced in Colombia and all cacao beans meet their ‘Fino de Aroma’ standards – fine cacao making up only 7% of the world’s total cacao.</p>
<p>“The whole trip was a real eye-opener,” Dawn said. “Luker is one of the biggest companies in Colombia. What is different about Luker compared to other cacao growers is that it makes the whole product from bean to bar in Colombia, meaning it uses Colombian sugar, milk and labour, exporting the finished product rather than just the cacao beans. So Colombian dairy farmers and sugar cane growers also benefit directly.”.</p>
<p>Dawn’s chocolate journey started the moment they touched down in Bogota with breakfast at the Luker factory of traditional hot chocolate, brioche and cheese. This was followed by chocolate tasting.</p>
<p>“Every single stage of how the beans are grown, harvested and processed into our chocolate makes a huge impact on the final taste”, Dawn explained. “One example was tasting chocolate that had been made with beans roasted at 130 degrees compared to those at 160 degrees. The difference in degrees had made the chocolate almost inedible!”.</p>
<p>The group were flown to Granja Luker – a training and research centre where the farmers are educated, and fino de aroma beans are cultivated and grown into saplings which are sold to farmers for their own plantations. Since its founding in 1962, Granja Luker has educated 700 farmers a year to grow and cultivate Fino de Aroma cocoa beans.</p>
<p>One highlight for Dawn was a visit to Necocli, which is very near the gateway to Panama. A few years ago, Luker planted 550 hectares there with 600,000 new cacao trees, creating 180 new jobs in an area known for armed conflict. The villagers, including their three schools within this area have been hugely supported by Luker.</p>
<p>Dawn said: “We visited two of the schools within the cacao plantation and were asked to take the children educational gifts and tell them something about our lives. I took postcards of Chichester and the Witterings to show the children where I live and so they can use them to write back to me and I will pass those to local schoolchildren. I would love to be able to make a connection with schools in West Sussex and Colombia.</p>
<p>The village within the cacao plantation known as ‘Caribia’, has been transformed thanks to The Chocolate Dream project. The Chocolate Dream was born out of Luker Chocolate’s long-term vision to lead social and economic development in the cocoa-producing regions. Luker began to wonder about their responsibility as a company. What more could they bring to the countryside, to the people, the children, and neighbours? Volunteers working under The Chocolate Dream project have helped to paint houses, encouraged villagers to start up micro businesses with their traditional cane weaving and jewellery making. On the coastal strip of Necocli, they aim to build the town into a thriving holiday destination. The Chocolate Dream Project has helped at least 11 new start-up businesses including a young lad to set up a micro museum, after he discovered ancient artefacts dating back to the Spanish settlement in 1509 buried in his garden.”</p>
<p>The trip has transformed Dawn’s outlook.:</p>
<p>She said: “I feel so privileged to have been given this opportunity to visit Colombia and learn the history and story behind the lives of people who are growing great chocolate. .</p>
<p>Having used their chocolate for over a decade, and now seen the work that Luker and their Chocolate Dream project are doing, I am so excited to help them share this story Maria de Restrepo was a member of Luker Chocolate’s founding family. Every Saturday, in Manizales, she would stand at her window to give out chocolate to the homeless for the sole reason of consoling them and making sure they had food in their stomachs. At that time, there had been no research on the ‘happiness of eating chocolate’, but what she did and the chocolate she gave out must have comforted many. I guess that by using Luker chocolate today, I am doing the same – not only supporting the families at the source of this journey, but by bringing the happiness of sharing their fine chocolate with my customers. The Swiss named cacao ‘Theobroma’ in the 18th century, meaning ‘food of the gods’. I like to believe I am a modern day version of a ‘chocolate goddess’ and it is my duty to bring the best chocolate to everyone’s door. And if it can be done in a way that I know I am helping and supporting the families that supply it, then that’s even better.”</p>

      content: `<p>At Luker Chocolate, every day we set out and strive to grow based on our higher purpose: to make the world a better place, by helping other companies create purpose-driven products, using our chocolate as a tool for change. This future and change that we dream of begins in the cocoa-producing regions of Colombia, from where we grow the best Cacao Fino de Aroma. But we didn’t want to stop there. That’s why, a few years ago, we decided to put all our strength into the Colombian countryside to offer real solutions. That’s where “The Chocolate Dream” was born.</p>
<p>The challenge is enormous. In Colombia, cocoa is produced in 27 of the 32 departments, resulting in great geographical dispersion in terms of production and a number of barriers for producers and their families. In addition, Colombia’s main cocoa-growing regions have historically been zones of armed conflict, illegal mining, drug trafficking, etc.; and unfortunately, many still are today. Despite obstacles appearing time and again along the way, our dream is even greater. We know that we cannot do it alone and that the key to achieving our goal is teamwork. It is only in through teamwork that we will be able to make “The Chocolate Dream” stop being just a dream.</p>
<img src="/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg" alt="Forest Necoclí">
<p>A clear reflection of the union and joint efforts is the Cocoa, Forests and Peace initiative, a public-private project aimed at promoting zero-deforestation production models that favour the protection and restoration of forests in the cocoa supply chain, but also contribute to building peace in our country.</p>
<p>The initiative was born in March 2017 when the Declaration of Intent for the Global Cocoa and Forests Initiative was launched, led by the World Cocoa Foundation, The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), non-profit organisations, and more than 35 private sector companies, who signed the macro agreements for joint action in Ghana and Ivory Coast, mainly. In July 2018, Colombia became the first country in Latin America and the third in the world to adhere to the initiative and sign its own agreement.</p>
<img src="/static/media/cocoa-forest.dfaf6862.jpg" alt="Cocoa forest">
<p>Luker Chocolate was the first private sector company to believe in and sign the Cocoa, Forests, and Peace initiative in Colombia. We participated in the planning and structuring of the action plan, which was officially launched last September in Bogotá. We decided to be part of this project because we know that the basis of everything we do lies in the cocoa-producing regions, because that is our source of inspiration and the opportunity we have to transform communities.</p>
<p>So, this initiative sets in motion its 10-year action plan, led by the ministries of Environment and Sustainable Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, the cocoa industry represented by Luker Chocolate and the National Federation of Cocoa Growers (Fedecacao), the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), and the World Resources Institute (WRI), with the support of the World Cocoa Foundation.</p>
<p>It will be 10 years of working, shoulder to shoulder, in which we seek to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>45 milestones in total (25 in the short term, 12 in the medium term, and 8 in the long term).</li>
<li>76 activities over 2 years.</li>
<li>51 management indicators for 2-year activities.</li>
<li>More than 73 indicators that will measure the information system.</li>
<li>5 major results by 2030:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Zero deforestation cocoa production models.</li>
<li>Financial instruments that consolidate cocoa models with zero</li>
<li>orestation.</li>
<li>Monitoring, verification, and traceability systems.</li>
<li>Strengthening of cocoa institutions for forests and peace.</li>
<li>Communication and transparency strategies.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following new signatories will also join forces for the implementation phase: the Swiss Embassy (SECO), Climate Focus, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Organización Alisos, Rainforest Alliance, Lök Foods, Mariana Cocoa Export, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), WWF and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).</p>
<p>Cocoa, Forests, and Peace is a very important milestone for cocoa farming in Colombia and everything behind it. It will be the first major pact for the sustainable development of cocoa production in the country that will be made by the three sectors of the economy. This project will be a very important contribution in the protection and conservation of all the natural wealth with which cocoa coexists. It will also transform the realities of the country’s cocoa farming families today, help overcome difficulties, and offer a better future for the Colombian countryside.</p>

      date: 'NOVEMBER 2019',
      content: `<p>For over 30 years, the annual PLMA (Private Label Manufacturing Association) trade show has been the most important event in the United States where retailers and industry gather information and meet suppliers to develop their private brands. In this year’s event, more than 1500 companies from 40 countries will exhibit their products and services, and it will include 25 international pavilions.</p>
<p>We have participated in this event for over five years, but this time we decided to present ourselves somewhat differently, starting with our very stand. This year, we have a more experiential stand, where visitors will be able to experience the Luker Chocolate Market, a space where they can learn about our 110 years of experience as master chocolatiers taken to the world of some of the food megatrends: the premium, ethical, and healthy world.</p>
<p>This year we decided to go further and present ourselves at the New Product Expo, a platform where only some of the participating companies will be able to exhibit their latest innovations in products and packaging. The products will be exhibited at the Idea SuperMarket, a part of the fair that shows what supermarkets, hypermarkets and retailers of all kinds are doing with their brands. The products that will be shown here are selected based on their level of innovation determined by a jury. A couple of weeks after we submitted our ideas, we received the great news of having had two of our innovations selected: Beau Cao and Protein Pud.</p>
<img src="/static/media/beau-cau.cbf77ddd.jpg" alt="Beau Cao">
<p>Today we are going to tell you what Beau Cao is all about. Beau Cao is a product developed from VitalCao, a line of Luker Chocolate’s functional ingredients offering cocoa powders with the best benefits derived from cocoa. After 11 years of intense research and thanks to all the possibilities afforded by being present throughout our chocolate value chain, from the cocoa bean to the final product, we developed a unique production method, patent pending, where we control post-harvest practices (fermentation and drying) and the industrial process to obtain a large amount of antioxidants from cocoa. All this has resulted in a portfolio of natural products that provide health benefits in the modern era.</p>
<p>One of VitalCao’s strongest innovations is its ability to protect the body’s cells from UV rays. The antioxidant properties of VitalCao prevent the formation of free radicals triggered by exposure to ultraviolet rays. Based on the benefits of VitalCao and understanding that beauty is a process that must be cultivated from the inside out, at Luker Chocolate we decided to launch Beau Cao, a product that is both indulgent and cares for your skin by reconstituting it from within.</p>
<p>Beau Cao’s formula helps protect cells up to 60% more than regular chocolate, which means your body is protected from the sun’s rays from within. It also helps to reduce inflammation that may occur in skin tissues up to 26% more than regular chocolate.</p>
<p>At Luker Chocolate, we conducted a medical study with Ikemia IUCT (a Spanish high-tech business group aimed at developing and exploiting new products) to scientifically prove the benefits of daily consumption of Beau Cao. For a year, 10 healthy subjects, with an average age of 35.4 years and skin type II (according to the FitzPatrick scale), consumed 4 to 6 grams of VitalCao daily. We then exposed 1×1 cm areas of their untanned skin on the inner side of the forearm to increasing doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR, model 601 multiport solar simulator, sunlight, Glenside, PA). The results showed that there was a significant increase in the skin’s photoprotective effect, which is directly related to the product’s high antioxidant activity.</p>
<p>Clinical studies made by our research and development department, prove that the 45% cocoa Beau Cao has 75% more flavanols (components found in some foods that help the body protect itself from damage caused by oxidising agents such as ultraviolet rays, environmental pollution, chemicals in food, etc.) than a regular milk chocolate with the same cocoa content. The 58% and 70% cocoa content versions (the 70% one is the one we will present at PLMA) contain 57% and 47% more flavanols respectively than a regular chocolate.</p>
<p>You will find more information about our product in this infographic:</p>

If you want to learn more about the product, come to the Luker Chocolate Market to be held in the North Hall, stand F3011, from November 17 to 19 at the Rosemont Convention Centre in Chicago.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you!</p>
<small>*These studies were carried out by internal investigations of Casa Luker S.A. The declaration of benefits of this product must be approved by the competent regulatory entities, according to the country and with the fulfilment of the corresponding requirements.</small>

      title: 'PROTEIN PUD, THE PERFECT SNACK',
      date: 'NOVEMBER 2019',
      content: `<p>In last week’s blog, we told you about our participation in the PLMA (Private Label Manufacturing Association) fair, where our clients and event attendees will be able to take part in the Luker Chocolate Market experience. We will also present one of our latest product innovations: Beau Cao, a chocolate that nurtures beauty from the inside. We will exhibit the product at the New Product Expo, a platform where only some of the companies taking part in the fair will be able to exhibit their latest innovations.</p>
<p>Today, the protagonist of this blog is the Protein Pud, the second innovative product that we will exhibit on the platform. A formulation that we have developed for our clients who would like to have it in their private label portfolio. Here we are going to tell you how the creative process of this product was.</p>
<img src="/static/media/protein-pud.e083a995.jpg" alt="Protein pud">
<p>Today, people have less time to stay home and to prepare homemade meals. They have other priorities such as a social life and personal care. This is why snacks have become the perfect solution to lengthen the time between one meal and another, while also being satisfying.</p>
<p>Based on the behavior of these consumers, we decided to develop the Protein Pud: an instant soy protein pudding sweetened with stevia that doesn’t need refrigeration. A perfect, quick to prepare, healthy, delicious, and satisfying snack. With its innovative formulation all you have to do is add a little cold water to obtain your desired texture. It is an herbal product, so it is suitable for vegans. And to make the Protein Pud experience even more memorable, you can add different toppings such as nuts, dried or fresh fruit, cocoa nibs, etc.</p>
<p>Our Research and Development team spent more than 6 months searching for the right formulation to create the balance between texture and taste. First, we looked for the raw materials that would give us the creamy, soft sensation we wanted. Then, there was the challenge of maintaining the exquisite flavour and texture of chocolate made with our characteristic Cacao Fino de Aroma. However, the most important challenge was to find a way for all of these properties to be maintained in a cold-water preparation without the pudding cracking or becoming granular.</p>
<p>Aside from being indulgent and innovative, the Protein Pud is a good source of protein, one of the most important nutrients in the human body, vital for muscle formation and which plays a fundamental role in the proper functioning of the immune system. In addition, it provides calcium, a complex of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, and minerals such as iron, zinc and copper.</p>
<p>With the formula perfected, the ultimate question was how to show the world and our customers this innovation. To this end, we developed two product presentations. One is the ‘on the go’, individual presentation, designed for people who want to have a snack anytime, anywhere. The other, the ‘home presentation’, is ideal for preparing something delicious and healthy while at home away from the routine.</p>

      title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS',
      date: 'DECEMBER 2019',
      content: `<p>This story began 8 years ago, when against all odds we arrived in Necocli, Urabá antioqueño, to cultivate our first cocoa forest.</p>
<img src="/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg" alt="Forest Necoclí">
<p>For years this has been a region that has carried the burden of violence and all that this implies: poverty, inequality, lack of education, loss of meaning of life and hope.</p>
<p>Upon its arrival, Luker decided not only to have the best Fine Flavour Cocoa crop in the country, but also to become a model of sustainability where people are the centre: its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>After 7 years of positive impacts on the neighbouring communities of the 550-hectare forest, in 2017 one of the districts most benefited from the project took the initiative -hand-in-hand with The Chocolate Dream team- to celebrate the company’s historic arrival in their lives through a festival.</p>
<p>Caribia, a province where neither the State nor other private companies had reached, had not celebrated any festivities in years, it had no patron saint’s day and the Cocoa Festival was the best opportunity to start a new tradition.</p>
<p>2017 marked the beginning of this milestone for the Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Chocó and indigenous communities that inhabit this territory, the celebration was a success, and today it is only compared to the arrival of electricity 40 years ago. So they had to continue with the tradition, turn it into the territory’s heritage, the celebration of the cocoa harvest, and its effects on the lives of the locals.</p>
<p>And so it was that in 2018, we decided to do it again and now we are planning it together with Luker, the locals, the leaders, the Luker Foundation, as a single entity jointly defining what will be the most awaited festival of the year.</p>
<p>This planning has involved great revolutions based on events that seemed irrelevant at first such as the definition of the agenda of activities. Together we began to meet to define timetables, people, allied budgets and activities.</p>
<p>During this process of consensus and dissertations we discovered the importance of cultural, social, empathic and respectful dialogue involving different beliefs.</p>
<p>The community’s first proposal included topics such as cock fights, beauty pageants, motorcycle tours, cultural presentations, gastronomic samples, dances, songs and thousands of other things that identified them. Luker presented photography contests, craft workshops, chocolate tastings and other things that represented us.</p>
<p>In both proposals, there were enormous coincidences that made us feel like we had a single dream, a single purpose. But at the same time, as is natural when cultures meet, there were differences in some themes. And as we have always done, we decided to start conversing to find common ground.</p>
<p>We had two themes that distanced us, cockfighting and the beauty pageant, both so traditional in Colombian culture. So we began to talk about these issues.</p>
<p>From the company we respectfully proposed to omit the cockfights generating environmental and animal awareness. We also proposed that instead of celebrating women’s beauty, we should acknowledge their talent and their role in the more than 5 ethnic groups that live in the same territory.</p>
<p>Our respectful stance on deep-rooted culture was that over time we would modify beliefs and behaviours and that the Cocoa Festival could reflect a joint way of looking at life, where people, animals, nature, and culture deserved the greatest respect.</p>
<img src="/static/media/foto-tarima.0cef3648.jpg" alt="Cocoa Festival">
<h3>We had a big, beautiful surprise.</h3>
<p>Far from being discarded and generating discord, our proposals were immediately understood. We also saw how these positions were already incorporated in the community on an individual level, and that, in their own personal reflection, they all had had these concerns, but this had not reached the collective. The Cocoa Festival was becoming a vehicle that would help to put certain topics on the table.</p>
<p>In a 3-hour long conversation, more than one and a half hours of planning were devoted to reflect on the beauty pageant; topics were touched on, led by the community, around the great talent of their women, the change in understanding the role of women, their importance in the culture and the differences between one ethnic group and another in that understanding. There was a reflection on what it means to put a young woman on a catwalk in a territory that had been sexist for years, the risk it represents and the message it sends to children.</p>
<p>It was incredible to see and hear in the voices of those who are sometimes considered uneducated or behind in world trends, as they wish to contribute to gender equality, women’s empowerment, human rights education, and how they can use the festival to implement a ritual for the creation of values, to reinterpret beliefs and to celebrate the abundance and opportunities that a product, cocoa, has brought into their lives.</p>
<p>The same thing happened with the cockfight, the consensus around this issue was very fast and we all decided to highlight values of care for the environment that this practice does not reflect.</p>
<p>We left this meeting not only with a new agenda, with competitions for talented women and with environmental tours, but also with the firm conviction that these actions that sometimes do not seem to have as much impact as a festival, in the end are nothing more than the manifestation of the reinterpretation of the culture of a community and its encounter with other beliefs and communities.</p>
<p>We witnessed a change that is not easy to witness in a country of traditions. The 2018 Cocoa Festival was a tribute to farmers, women, animals and nature.</p>
