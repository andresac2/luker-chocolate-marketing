      title: 'IN THE SHOES OF: THE COCOA FARMERS OF HUILA',
      content: '<p>JULY 2019</p> This series is based on the experience of three of our collaborators who went to Huila to live and work as cocoa farmers. In this first story, José Maldonado, Sustainable Supply Analyst, tells us about his experience. <p></p>From a very young age, the countryside and I have been inseparable. My paternal grandfather is a veterinarian and has been a milk producer all his life, while my maternal grandfather is a coffee farmer, as were his ancestors for several generations. I’ve always been proud of the Colombian countryside and I’ve identified myself as part of it, so much so that I have often told people that I am from the countryside with my head held high.<p></p>I thought I had a lot of experience, but after spending two weeks accompanying different cocoa farming families in Huila, I realized I couldn’t be more in the wrong. To be from the countryside requires courage and sacrifice, but above all, you need to have a giant heart and be deeply in love with the land and its traditions.<p></p>On this journey, I met many people, but the stories that I am going to tell below belong to people who taught me great life lessons.<p></p>On this journey, I met many people, but the stories that I am going to tell below belong to people who taught me great life lessons.<p></p>The first was Pedro Nel Córdoba; he met us at the Neiva airport and welcomed us. This Opita with his sung accent is the representative of Luker Chocolate’s Agricultural Development department for Huila, Tolima, Putumayo and Caquetá. There is no supplier, farm or association where he is not greeted with a big hug and like a brother returning home. Pedro knows and understands his land perfectly, because, full of pride, he often recalls that he grew up in the countryside and that his parents raised him and 5 brothers with the produce of 1 hectare of cocoa. He knows what it means to fight and work for a farm that, no matter how small, is the essence and source of life that sustains thousands of farmer families in Colombia.<p></p>The team led by Pedro was ready to embark on our 2-week journey through this beautiful department. We started in the municipality of Rivera, where we visited three families belonging to the Association of Cocoa Producers of the Municipality of Rivera (ASOPROCAR). I was fortunate enough to visit Doña Carmen’s farm, an 82-year-old woman, but with the heart and soul of a 20-year old. She is the matron of her family and is proud to be the head of four generations, but even more so, to see her children succeeding thanks to the life and education she was able to give them with the 3 hectares of cocoa that she worked on for so many years with her late husband.<p></p> Doña Carmen’s house is right next to her cocoa plantation. It is a home full of love and particulars; it is full of Catholic images and photographs with her family. During the visit, we toured all of her plantation and, plant by plant, this woman showed us how hard she works for her cocoa trees and how well she knows them. <p></p>The following day was revelatory, as it was time to harvest and shell the cocoa pods. Two workers were in charge of collecting them and there was also a shelling team, which we were part of. What seemed like a simple task turned out to be exhausting. In an hour, I had to stop twice, stand up, stretch and wait for my back pain to pass. Meanwhile, Doña Carmen, 82, did not complain once and only stopped for lunch. She just laughed when she saw us struggling to complete the task. That’s how I learned about the admirable strength and character of the people of Huila.<p></p>Our next stop was the neighbouring municipality of Campoalegre, the rice capital of Huila. A region with an agricultural vocation, marked by beautiful valleys with different types of crops. In this place, I was particularly marked by a farm in a mountainous area, where coffee is beginning to predominate. There we met Doña Concha, her son Gentil, and the person who would give me a great life lesson: Samuel. This more or less 35-year-old dark-skinned man, with a well-groomed moustache and an infectious joy, has his own corn and coriander crop on the farm and was one of our guides.<p></p>Samuel has been blind for 8 years, but we could not believe it, and it was not because we doubted his word, but because of the way in which he finds his way around the farm. He never gets lost and even walks very dangerous roads all by himself. The most incredible thing about this man is his attitude. At one point, he was asked if it had been very difficult to regain his life after losing his sight, and he quietly replied, “Only a little”.<p></p>After touring Huila, we set out on a road of about 86 kilometres to the south of the department. We travelled along the banks of the Magdalena River and the giant Quimbo Dam until our last destination: Garzón. This municipality is an important coffee-growing centre in Colombia and a great agricultural pantry for the region. It has also become a very important cocoa collection point for Luker Chocolate. This is where I had the most significant encounter and perhaps the one that inspired me the most to continue to work for the cocoa farmers of Colombia.<p></p>On the penultimate day of our journey, we went to the Majo trail to visit Don Ismael’s farm. Don Ismael is approximately 80 years old and native of the region. Our main host was “Chucho”, one of his sons who takes care of him and helps him with the work on the cocoa plantation. We had the opportunity to help them during the working day by collecting the ripe cocoa cobs throughout the morning. It wasn’t until the end of the day, and after enjoying a nice sancocho, that the character that influenced me immensely arrived.<p></p>A 12-year-old boy, redheaded and full of freckles, came in from the back door. He wore knee-length jeans, a white vest, a slingshot across his chest, and rubber boots. He brought a bucket full of small fish he had just caught in a nearby river. He looked like a Colombian Tom Sawyer, an adventurous child; one of those that are in danger of extinction. Without thinking about it, he approached us to show us the catch of the day and began to talk to us about everything he did after school. His name is Wilmer and he’s Don Ismael’s grandson. He took me on a tour to show me his onion crop, some ducks he is raising, and finally, full of pride, he showed me his own cocoa tree. A thought came into my head: “the Colombian countryside does have a great future and it is because of children like him that we must continue to work”.<p></p>Wilmer is an enterprising and curious child. At a very early age, he began to help his mother, as their father left them when he was just a baby. But this never stopped him. His way of seeing life, of appreciating agriculture, his desire to get ahead and the way he helps his family, marked me in an indescribable way.',

      content: '<p>Chapter 2</p><blockquote > <p><em>“Thank you, God, for the food before us today and for giving us the blessing of being able to enjoy it. We pray for those who do not have enough to eat, for the sick, for prisoners, and the kidnapped. We thank you for the opportunity to meet here today and for the presence of these doctors and engineers who have come to help us progress, to improve our countryside, our farms, and our lives. Amen”.&nbsp; Prayer of Don Jesús, cocoa farmer in Huila.</em></p></blockquote><p>Standing with his eyes closed, and holding hands with the people around him, this was the prayer that Jesus Augusto Gomez uttered aloud before inviting us to the table. The chicken <em>sancocho</em> had been prepared on a wood-burning stove as you could tell by its smoky taste, by the smell of wood in the air, and by the smoke blowing out from Doña Elvira Quintero de Gómez roof. The table was laid with a classic hand-woven tablecloth, very typical of Colombian peasant houses, with plates from different sets collected over the years and cutlery of different styles and shapes. <strong>The soup, the main course and a delicious <em>agua de panela</em> were arranged in each one of the 8 carefully placed spaces at Doña Elvira’s wooden table.</strong> In total, there were 11 of us, so after the prayer, Don Jesus, his wife Doña Elvira, and their son “El Mono”, moved to let the guests sit down and have lunch first. He said we were the priority. In spite of having worked all morning on his farm harvesting cocoa under the Huila sun (Colombia), and at the age of 75, he refused to sit down as a gesture of hospitality.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3719 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-3-min.png" alt="" width="689" height="763" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-3-min.png 689w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-3-min-271x300.png 271w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>The four of us from Bogotá were, in fact, complete strangers to this cocoa family. We had asked the associations <strong>ASOPROCAR</strong> and <strong>ASOPECA</strong>&nbsp;to take us to visit a farm in the region, because we wanted to learn about their reality, live in their environment for a few hours, and spend time with them for no other reason than to listen to what they had to tell us.</p><p>I have to confess that when we arrived in Huila, I had no clear idea of how they were going to receive us. I thought that our visit would make them suspicious because it’s not a common thing to do. We had arrived suddenly hoping to get into a family’s personal space for an entire day in exchange for nothing. I thought they would refuse to receive us or ask us what we were <em>really</em> there for. <strong>What would happen if you suddenly arrive at a house in Bogotá and asked to stay there all day?</strong> To my surprise, we were greeted with a big smile and a contagious kindness.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3717 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-2-min.png" alt="" width="689" height="736" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-2-min.png 689w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-2-min-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>After a short conversation to welcome us and to show us around the place, we went out into the 3-hectare cocoa plantation with very tall, old trees, with thick trunks, a typical characteristic of the area’s very traditional agriculture and practices. Don Jesus was walking with some difficulty, as he had an accident when he was young that injured his leg. He didn’t complain, but we could see that it was difficult for him to walk. He then told us that he had had five strokes, but that he was still working as usual. During the tour, he spontaneously told us anecdotes about his life. To the left of the path where we walked, there was a ravine with crystalline water, with huge stones and leafy vegetation. The shade of the cocoa trees and the sound of the ravine made for a cosy atmosphere that served as the backdrop for a conversation of about 2 hours. We learned about how Don Jesus managed his estate. Although he did not know for sure how much he produced, nor did he have any figures written down, he knew his trees like the palm of his hand.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3723 lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-7-min-300x295.png" alt="" width="800" height="787" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-7-min-300x295.png 300w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-7-min-768x755.png 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-7-min.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>After lunch where we were treated with so much hospitality, we spent time with the family who taught us how to prepare <em>guarapo</em>, a typical Colombian drink made with sugar cane juice. In the courtyard, they had an old cane-chopping machine. “El Mono” had already cut some of these plants that were ready to be put through the machine to extract the juice. We all helped, and in the end, obtained about 5 litters of guarapo. Tired out by the afternoon activity, we went to the kiosk where Don Orlando, leader of the cocoa association, who works with Don Jesus, invited for a brandy after dinner.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3721 lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-5-min-300x225.png" alt="" width="800" height="599" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-5-min-300x225.png 300w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-5-min-768x575.png 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Imagen-5-min.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>At the kiosk, Don Jesus told us more stories about his life, one of them about his leg accident. He told us that at the age of 20, he was chasing a girl he liked. One night, he wanted to go out on his horse to look for her. His mother warned him not to go out, that it was too late and that it was not the right thing to do. He went out anyway and fell from his horse, which almost left him disabled. The moral he had to share with us, in the end, was: “A mother always knows what’s best for you. Always listen to your parents”. Just then, Guillermo Valderrama, our 65-year-old-consultant, added, “That’s right, he who doesn’t listen to his mother, doesn’t listen to God’s voice”.</p><p>He also told us about how he had stopped drinking alcohol in his old age, thus losing many of his friends. He told us about his childhood secrets and his indelible memories of the era of bipartisan violence between liberals and conservatives – two Colombian political parties – during the 1950s. He told us how he saw many people die near the farm where he grew up and about the recent violence. At 75, he recounted these memories as if they had happened yesterday. His trauma was evident, but his conviction for the value of work, the countryside, agriculture, and peaceful community life was also strong.</p><p>As we were about to leave, “El Mono”, who had a mental disorder due to having drunk adulterated alcohol and who had been feeling depressed and lonely lately, told us: “thanks to your visit, my farm looks even more beautiful to me today”. Today has been an amazing and happy day for me. I learned more things than on any other day in the Bogotá office; I spoke with more empathy; I was more at peace; more human; happier; I hugged people I had never seen before; I enjoyed the tranquillity of the countryside; I met people who, despite not having been able to finish high school, knew more than I did; I was once again aware of the value of our countryside and of the human quality and drive of our peasants.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3713 lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/casas-de-campesinos-min-300x225.png" alt="" width="800" height="599" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/casas-de-campesinos-min-300x225.png 300w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/casas-de-campesinos-min-768x575.png 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/casas-de-campesinos-min.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>At Luker Chocolate, we will continue to work with them and for them, because it is they who make it possible for us to enjoy the food the earth gives us.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3732 size-full lazyload below-entry-meta" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fbago21Eng.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="628" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fbago21Eng.jpg 1200w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fbago21Eng-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fbago21Eng-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fbago21Eng-1024x536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>',

      title: 'A CHOCOLATE A DAY, KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY',
      content: '<p>Few people are aware of the&nbsp;<strong>great benefits of regular cocoa consumption;</strong>&nbsp;the vast majority of consumers are convinced (some by medical recommendations) that cocoa and/or chocolate are harmful to health. In order to solve this dispute, Luker Chocolate’s research area, in association with research centres in Colombia and Italy (University of Molise – Campo Basso, Sannio Tech – Benevento, and University of Brescia), characterised the cocoa from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and for over four years have developed a variety of experimental designs, including preclinical and clinical studies with 50 volunteers. Once the results were obtained, we discussed them with a group formed by the most renowned cardiologists, nutritionists, nutritionists, dermatologists, sportsmen, etc.</p><p > <img class="aligncenter wp-image-3430 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-1.png" alt="" width="629" height="579" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-1.png 629w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-1-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><p>Today, we have enough scientific and technical evidence to be able to assert that regular consumption of cocoa helps to improve and protect people’s health. But how much chocolate should we consume? Our recommendation is two servings of chocolate powder a day or one of dark chocolate for at least one month. This will help you to:</p><h3>PROTECT YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH</h3><p>Consuming cocoa&nbsp;<strong>helps reduce total cholesterol and bad cholesterol (LDL)</strong>, while increasing good cholesterol (HLD) and reducing or regulating the omega 6 and omega 3 ratio, helping to improve your heart health and decreasing the risks of such diseases. Your heart will become even stronger if, as well as consuming cocoa, you begin to acquire healthy lifestyle habits in your diet by decreasing the consumption of animal fats and carbs, while increasing your consumption of pulses and vegetables. We also recommend that you do some physical exercises such as walking up to 10,000 steps a day.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3428 size-full lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/post-fb-min-768x587.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="587" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/post-fb-min-768x587.jpg 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/post-fb-min-768x587-300x229.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><h3>PROTECT GASTRIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL HEALTH</h3><p>Cocoa contains fibre (insoluble and soluble) that helps to improve bowel movement and eliminate toxins from the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. These types of fibre have a prebiotic characteristic that feed probiotic microorganisms that maintain gastric health. It is important to remember that immune health is largely conditioned by gastric health; unfortunately many people have&nbsp;gastric problems due to the low intake of fibre from pulses and vegetables.</p><p>Tip: eat chocolate and vegetables daily, and you will notice how your gastric and immune health improves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>IMPROVE YOUR MOOD</h3><p>Cocoa has molecules that act as neurotransmitters of messages in the central nervous system. One of these is phenylethylamine, better known as the molecule of love. It has been proven that the brain of a person in love contains large amounts of this substance that could be responsible for certain sensations such as excitement, tachycardia, and redness, among others.&nbsp;<strong>This neurotransmitter triggers the action of other neurotransmitters called happiness molecules such as serotonin</strong>&nbsp;(generates a feeling of self-love and respect for others), oxytocin (generates a feeling of love for others and affective bonding), and dopamine (generates joy and a feeling of euphoria).</p><p>Tip: don’t make life bitter, take it easy and drink chocolate, the antidepressant par excellence. It really works.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3426 size-full lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-4.png" alt="" width="654" height="435" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-4.png 654w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-4-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p><h3>PRODUCING OR ACTIVATING THE BODY’S ENERGY SYSTEMS</h3><p><strong>Yes,&nbsp;consuming cocoa helps to produce energy or activate the existing energy in the body.</strong>&nbsp;Its potassium content&nbsp;and the activation of important proteins in the process of energy production, make cocoa a key morning food that will help you stay energised throughout the day.</p><p>Best of all, it doesn’t contain excessive doses of caffeine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>MAINTAIN THE OVERALL HEALTH</h3><p>This looks like a phrase taken from a youtuber’s video. It seems incredible or a little daring to claim. Let me explain. When we breathe or expose ourselves to the sun, our body releases substances that oxidise it and that are very reactive and dangerous. They are called free radicals and are incomplete molecules that go looking around our body for electrons to attach to. These radicals are the cause of the vast majority of chronic non-communicable diseases that cause the most deaths in the world, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity.&nbsp;<strong>Although our body produces its own antioxidants that quickly neutralise those free radicals or oxidising</strong>&nbsp;substances, stress, irregular mealtimes, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, and not exercising decrease the production of natural antioxidants and free radicals begin to take over. In other words, bad habits make us rusty! Fortunately there are foods like tea, grapes, blueberries and especially&nbsp;<strong>chocolate</strong>, which bring levels of antioxidants to the body preventing this from happening. In the specific case of cocoa, it has a substance called NFR2, which is a protein that reactivates the genes that produce our own antioxidant substances, further increasing the protection against chronic non-communicable diseases.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3424 size-full lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-5.png" alt="" width="424" height="637" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-5.png 424w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BLOG-5-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 85vw, 424px"></p><p>Cocoa also possesses significant quantities of minerals that promote the&nbsp;development of biological reactions, such as potassium, which plays a role in energy production and regulates the heart rate; calcium, which helps transmit nerve impulses as well as protecting against osteoporosis; iron, which helps fight anaemia; and zinc, which helps the immune system, the cognitive development of children and the maturation and maintenance of sexual activity over the years.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3422 size-large lazyload" src="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fbago28-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="440" srcSet="https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fbago28-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fbago28-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fbago28-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.lukerchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fbago28.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>',

They are able to produce in excess of 20,000 bars per day as well as small-volume batches of hand-finished chocolate, which makes us quite unique within the UK.<p></p>In 2015 Daniel’s Delights agreed a strategic partnership with Luker Chocolate. In their own words, they see us as a business wholly focused on investing in local rural communities and creating long term sustainable relationships with farmers and growers and moving them away formless sustainable farming practices and into Cacao production. Working tirelessly in rebuilding communities previously blighted by the trade-in coca leaves and through their work throughout Colombia has helped those communities by building schools and developing social enterprise schemes to allow them to become sustainable through the production of Cacao. That’s only a part of what made them choose Luker Chocolate as their provider. They also know that the Cacao we produce is classified by the ICCO as being in the top 8% of the global production in terms of quality and has the Cacao fino de aroma classification.<div class="blog-article-content--img" ><img src = "/static/media/5thdimensions.d697a540.png" alt = "" ><span></span></div>',

After trying different chocolates from France and Italy, in 2014 he coincidentally tried a homemade-style hot chocolate made by a Colombian chef in a culinary event in the Netherlands. He couldn’t believe that the flavour in the chocolate he was drinking could come from his very own country, while being so far away from the homeland. Since then, all the chocolate sufflés he makes at his restaurant are made with ingredients provided by Luker Chocolate.',

Dengel Shokolade launched a raw material concept in 2015. This is under the motto "honest and fair direct from the producer". Thus, the raw materials needed for chocolate production (cocoa beans, cane sugar, and milk) are purchased directly from cocoa farmers from Colombia. They produce noble and fine chocolates since 1992. For them, the purchase of Cacao Fino de Aroma directly from Colombia without intermediate trade and at a fair fixed price is unbeatable, allowing us to makes sure that equivalent funds are paid directly to the cocoa farmers.',

She made chocolate cakes and fudge for friends and family as a child, eventually melting Christmas chocolates in an attempt to create her own Easter Eggs. Since then, her interest in chocolate grew into an obsession, and so she set out to learn everything possible about chocolate. Every new thing she’s discovered drawn her deeper into the world of chocolate and introduced her to chocolate lovers, chocolate makers, chocolatiers and experts from around the world, including us. <p></p> For her, it’s very important to work with products that involve communities working side-by-side, giving her and other chocolate professionals to tell new stories through a positive experience, which is what we try to accomplish every day at Luker Chocolate.',
