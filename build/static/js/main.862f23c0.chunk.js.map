To add to this, at Granja Luker, we offer technical advice for crop improvement, training in improved agricultural practices, and we offer farmers the opportunity to update their crops with high quality Fino de Aroma varieties. This allows us better quality control in products and supply, guaranteeing our customers the availability of each of our Fino de Aroma chocolates.',\n  img: 'our-flavour-1.jpg'\n},\n{\n  title: 'VERTICAL INTEGRATION, OWN CROPS, AND TRACEABILITY',\n  content: 'In 2010, Luker Chocolate opted to grow its own crops to help the company satisfy its own Cacao Fino de Aroma needs. Without abandoning the relationships established with cocoa associations all over the country, the company set out to promote demonstrative agro industrial projects that would boost large-scale cocoa plantations to drive rural development. In the same year, the company found 550 hectares of land traditionally used for cattle farming in Necoclí, Antioquia. It turned this land into its first agro industrial plantation and the largest agro-productive plantation of varieties of Cacao Fino de Aroma, designed as an agroforestry system (simultaneous and continuous integration of fruit trees and timber-yielding varieties with agricultural crops, which allow greater yields and avoid soil erosion and loss of biodiversity). This project has allowed us to integrate the entire cocoa value chain, from the seed, to the final product, creating greater social and environmental well being in the territories in which we work. Thanks to this, we can control all cocoa processes, especially postharvest. This is how we can guarantee sustainability, transparency, supply, traceability, a superior flavour, and consistency in our products.',\n  img: 'cacaoOpen.jpg'\n},\n{\n  title: 'QUALITY PROCESS',\n  content: 'At Luker Chocolate, we continuously improve our analysis and quality control processes so that we can keep our promise of delivering a chocolate of unique and superior flavour, ensuring a sensory profile that is maintained over time. Our control process starts at our different points of purchase in the producing regions. Every purchased cocoa bean is analysed in terms of its fermentation level, humidity, and impurities. The beans are then taken to the cocoa storehouse in Bogotá, where the process is repeated. Cocoa liquor is produced in the cocoa laboratory, which we then use to validate the sensory profile of each batch of cocoa purchased and ratify that it actually matches the origin from which it has been purchased. During the chocolate manufacturing process, a third quality analysis is carried out by our quality panel. Two sensory quality panel sessions a day are held, where 15 highly qualified panellists analyse every batch of chocolate that is being manufactured.

At Granja Luker, our cocoa research centre, visitors from all over the world have been able to have hot chocolate for breakfast under gigantic legendary trees, many of which they have planted with their own hands.</p>\n<p>But why do we place so much importance on the trees? Because the great conversations of our grandparents and parents on the future, those from which they found inspiration and made transcendental decisions, did not take place in an office with them dressed in a suit and tie; quite the contrary, they took place under the leaves of trees as they wore their ponchos and hats.</p>\n<p>In our Cocoa Forest in Necoclí, we have been witness to the shade of the mythic Campano; an old tree that has sheltered different communities for generations, from the indigenous to the cocoa farmers, offering a space in its shade where people could sit to converse. We have dreamt, laughed, and cried under this tree.  We have found something relating to our humanity, we have connected with our roots, culture, and history. It is under this tree that we have forgotten our titles and our social condition, we have been equal; we have been sincere, we have confessed our greatest secrets and happily shared our differences.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg\" alt=\"Necoclí Forest\">\n<p>We have been chocolatiers in Colombia for 113 years and, even so, sometimes we forget that it is thanks to a tree that we can do what we do.

A company with a vision that even today, five generations later, is preserved, not only in one man and his family but in the hearts of the company’s 1000 plus collaborators.</p>\n<p>Over a century later, the dream has grown. We know that we can contribute more to the country through chocolate and we are sure that, with the support of many, this idea is beginning to consolidate and become a model in which rural Colombia and its inhabitants are the protagonists. We no longer dream of just a chocolate factory; our purpose today is to transform lives through it.</p>\n<p>The true story of Luker Chocolate’s social responsibility and sustainability is the account of a family legacy that started as a dream, and was then built and extended with all its members. In the search for Luker Chocolate’s highest purpose, we went back to look for its roots and found many stories of the legacy of a family, its values and convictions.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/the-birt-of-a-dream-1.38cc0657.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Let’s start with Maria de Restrepo, who was a member of Luker Chocolate’s founding family. Every Saturday, in Manizales, she would stand at her window to give out chocolate to the homeless for the sole reason of consoling them and making sure they had food in their stomachs. At that time, there had been no research on the “happiness of eating chocolate”, but what she did and the chocolate she gave out must have comforted many.</p>\n<p>Jaime Restrepo, founder of the Luker Foundation, is said to have supported anyone who approached him with a great idea, he would spend time listening to their ideas and he financed some of these projects. In time, this gave rise to the foundation, which later had a great benefactor, Inés Restrepo Mejía, who has always supported causes around children, education and women. She decided to leave all her legacy to the foundation, today allowing the implementation of programs that have had a great positive impact in Manizales, in terms of education and entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>The story goes on thanks to the new generations of the family which continues to build the country. Many of them have been involved in social projects, foundations, a vocation for service, and the conviction that with the effort of many, it is possible to build a dream. All of the above is the inspiration for the construction of a sustainable model in which we want Luker Chocolate to last another 100 years as a business. We want it to be able to contribute to all those around us, our collaborators, farmers, their families and our customers around the world.</p>\n<p>The company’s current leaders have opted to continue this legacy and take it to another level. Over the years, the company has evolved and found new opportunities, not only in the domestic market but also in international markets. In that evolution, it was decided that the chocolate business would take a different course from that of CasaLuker, the mass consumer business. This is how Luker Chocolate was born, a company that sells chocolate to the world; chocolate made with the best Cacao Fino de Aroma. This new business model goes from selling a product to offering an integral service around chocolate, with innovative, competitive equipment and, above all, with a superior purpose.</p>\n<p>We began to renew the company internally, maintaining the over 100-year family tradition, but adding the new global trends addressing sustainability. We want to contribute to the country through an economic, environmental, and socially responsible model. In this sense, we have always been a company that has worked closely with Colombian farmers in the different cocoa regions. We have accompanied them through Granja Luker for over 60 years to train them as producers, so that they have a more technical understanding of the field, helping them to improve productivity and their quality of life.</p>\n<p>However, a few years ago we began to ask ourselves about new paths for business, for the countryside, and for small farmers. In this search for new sustainable models for the cocoa-growing regions, which also largely coincide with the regions most affected by the armed conflict, we embarked on a new course towards planting our own crops. This is how we arrived in Necocli, in Urabá antioqueño, to open the way for cocoa in an area where violence was the protagonist for so many years. We arrived against all odds to plant 550 hectares of cocoa in a land that had long been used for livestock farming. The transformation was a milestone in the region. It went from five to 180 jobs, from a farm with only grass, to the planting of 600,000 new trees. Stability and future began to be considered through formal hiring; women began to play a leading role in the field.</p>\n<p>There are still many challenges to overcome in the nearby villages. Multidimensional poverty rates are still very high and the aftermath of violence is still visible in the eyes of the children. The whole team that was embarking on this new phase began to wonder about our responsibility as a company. What more could we bring to the countryside, to the people, to the children, to our neighbors? This is how The Chocolate Dream was born, Luker Chocolate’s long-term vision to lead social and economic development in the cocoa-producing regions where we work. Little by little, the Dream became the DNA of the company’s sustainability strategy; we knew we could do more and we discovered how to do it. Today, Luker Chocolate has a strategy in which the economic, environmental and social components carry the same weight and in which the business model is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p>We capitalized on all the good practices of more than 110 years in a model of integrated intervention in the territories, not only in Necocli, but also in Casanare, Huila, Tumaco and, in the med-term, the other cocoa-growing parts of the country. We know that we are responsible for the course Colombia is taking and for our planet. We want the Colombian countryside to become a protagonist, not because of the suffering caused by the violence, but because of its prosperity, its dignity, its potential for development, its knowledge, its art and its culture.</p>\n<p>We have fully integrated our value chain to achieve this, first humanizing its links. We are no longer talking about raw materials but about farmers and communities; we are no longer talking about the transformation of cocoa but about equipment with purpose; we are not only talking about income but also about clients with life projects. We are also looking to make our value chain not linear but circular, so that the client can give something back to the countryside through projects created by us and financed by them, in order to improve the living conditions of the communities and farmers who work day by day to bring the best chocolate to their country.</p>\n<p>The Chocolate Dream manages to open new dialogues with anyone who has a product made with our chocolate on their mind. Luker Chocolate is of the best quality but also carries within it the history of our Colombian countryside.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/the-birth-of-a-dream.68663234.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>We know that many of us can join together to turn this dream into a movement that can travel the world. This is why The Chocolate Dream will soon open its doors so that all those who want to contribute with their knowledge, their experience and their time, can find a place where they can do so at Luker Chocolate.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.

We can say that those businesses that effectively satisfy a need, and at the same time manage to charge enough to cover their costs and generate a profit, will have created economic value.</p>\n<p>The problem with this, as is prone to happen nowadays, is that many companies have become obsessed with fighting within the same consumer segments as their competitors and worse yet, offering the same product or service. They have fallen into the trap of intensifying competition, investing huge amounts of money in advertising, and trying to excel by means of tiny incremental innovations. Gaining a point in market share over the competitor has become an obsession that consumes large amounts of resources, time and brilliant minds.</p>\n<p>Having stated that the purpose of a business has to do with solving needs, at what point did we move away from trying to solve the large, urgent, and complex needs of our society? Is it not true that pollution, health, nutrition, housing, poverty, lack of water, violence and education, among many others, are needs? Why do companies distance themselves from society’s most complex and relevant needs? Why do we not see the important needs as the huge business opportunities that they are?</p>\n<p>Towards the end of 2018, I had the opportunity to attend Professor Michael Porter’s Shared Value course at Harvard Business School. Professor Porter and his team invite us to reflect on how we have grown with the conventional wisdom that believes that social problems need to be solved by the government and NGOs, but not by companies. This road that we have travelled for decades is leading us to the destruction of our planet. Society in general has not been effective in solving the most serious problems. We are not on the right track. This is not the way forward.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe that within the concept of shared value, at its core, a new notion of business strategy can be found and represents a real and powerful disruption to our understanding of business. Although it is a concept that is maturing in different ways, only the bravest entrepreneurs —those who dare to work with it—will help refine its understanding. Creating shared value means solving a social problem through a business model; a business that thinks like a business and manages to create economic value as a result of solving a social problem. And it is precisely the ability to create economic value —profit—that allows us to think about sustainable and scalable solutions, which is something that typically NGOs or governments cannot do.</p>\n<p>In addition to the concept of shared value, there are many other lines of thinking that point towards a common interest. Among them, I invite you to study the powerful initiatives led by Sir Ronald Cohen and his ideas on Impact Investment, the vision of B-Lab and its growing and inspiring B-Corp movement, the different approaches within conscious capitalism and many other working groups and their experiences that we will be discussing on our blog. Independent of the academic preferences and affinities of each of the approaches, what I really want to invite our customers, suppliers, allies, entrepreneurs and businesspeople to do, is to start asking ourselves very seriously: What is the role we want our companies and our brands to play in the urgent mission to change the direction of our society? How can we reinterpret the role of business, to provide solid solutions to relevant problems?</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/unique-flavour.b9eb31ba.jpg\" alt=\"Luker brand\">\n<p>At Luker Chocolate we firmly believe that companies have perhaps the most powerful capacity to offer real and scalable solutions to pressing and urgent problems. We also believe that it is important to share experiences and lessons learnt. We have a certain optimism and celebrate alongside an increasingly large group of companies around the world who have been encouraged to understand business as a tool for change. These include existing companies, as well as the strong wave of new social entrepreneurs who we should encourage, help, and empower.</p>\n<p>At Luker Chocolate, over the past 113 years, we have been sensitive to trying to help different communities, essentially thanks to a set of values ​​inherited across five generations. Throughout our history, we have tried different approaches, from philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, to social work by the Luker Foundation on education and entrepreneurship issues. For some years, we have been evolving that interest to try to incorporate the idea of ​​shared value at the heart of the business strategy. I have to say that it has not been easy, or fast. It is not a clear or simple path, especially as this is a business that is already up and running, and so this implies the rethinking of multiple activities as we go along. One of the most complex challenges that we are looking at today has to do precisely with measuring social impact and its correlation with the creation of economic value for the company. However, despite the challenges and demands, and although there are many elements that are still under construction, from my professional experience it has been a wonderful journey. We have followed a path that has allowed us to innovate and visualize new ways in which our operation and business model can positively impact society. The journey has been rewarding in its humanity.</p>\n<p>Along our journey, we have been able to stop to reflect and explore our industry’s most complex problems, namely, the way the cocoa-producing territories in Colombia where we work have been marked by historical violence, drugs, illegality, poverty, lack of opportunities, and lack of infrastructure and education, among many others. Seeing these problems from the perspective of shared value has led us to innovate, to try to solve things. And it is innovation that is an indispensable tool for the incorporation of shared value into a strategy. Innovation represents an absolute priority when trying to solve complex social problems and, at the same time, create economic value. Given that these adverse conditions are unchartered territory, it is experimentation that allows us to learn and deal with the different challenges. All the efforts will start to make sense only when we begin to see the tangible social results.</p>\n<p>At Luker Chocolate, we provide chocolate as an ingredient for industry and we manufacture finished products for other brands around the world. Our clients range from small artisanal chocolatiers to large industries, from entrepreneurs who are launching new brands to large, well-established retailers. They all have three things in common: a marked interest in and a commitment to supporting social and environmental impacts, an entrepreneurial mindset that looks for innovation, and a clear priority for superior flavour and quality. As a B4B (Business for business) company, at Luker Chocolate we say that our mission is to help other companies create purpose-driven chocolate products. Our clients are mostly active protagonists of The Chocolate Dream, our long-term vision to transform the cocoa regions where we operate. There are several ways in which we visualize our alignment with the purpose of our clients and how we can help them to strengthen their brands and business models:</p>\n<h3>A CONNECTION TO THE ORIGIN THROUGH IMPACT PROJECTS</h3>\n<p>Alongside our clients, we co-create social impact projects in the different cocoa regions and for the communities that are part of our own cocoa forests. We jointly invest in education, entrepreneurship, art and culture, and the environment. We are committed to improving rural economic diversification along different axes such as tourism and other market initiatives with a view to building prosperity and strengthening regions’ competitiveness. Through this approach, our clients also build connections by committing to the unknown, with innovative experimental projects that allow us to create new knowledge together. In these projects, we can also help our clients to design unique strategies on how to connect their consumers with their impact, improving their brand equity through emotional and meaningful connections.</p>\n<h3>THE COCOHABS, OUR CENTRE FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>\n<p>This space is dedicated to hosting people who voluntarily come from all over the world to give their time and knowledge to support the local communities, rural entrepreneurs, and to generate solutions to real problems in the area. The aim of this space is to open the doors to different disciplines to enhance our insight into social innovation. Our customers, their consumers, our suppliers, and allies are welcome to pursue this unique experience.</p>\n<h3>IMPACT THROUGH NEW PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT</h3>\n<p>As well as tasting unique from being made from 100% Cacao Fino de Aroma, many of our new product developments are being conceptualized and designed with a social mission in mind: from sugar-free chocolates enhanced with fibre and proteins to contribute to healthy diets, to much more sophisticated formulations with functional ingredients that seek specific improvements in nutrition, given the powerful antioxidant capability of cocoa. We are always reviewing multiple ingredients that can accompany our chocolates to enhance their ability to improve health, whilst keeping their indulgent quality. Our strength is based on single origin dark chocolates. Vegan chocolates and other health-conscious concepts are a permanent part of our exploration and input into creating products aimed at improving people’s health through what they eat and how they indulge. Sustainable packaging and environment impact are a central part of our products.</p>\n<p>These are only 3 of the many other initiatives where we can help infuse a brand with purpose. Purpose must be discovered, visualized, and encouraged to be incorporated at the forefront of our venture. We dream of helping to create, together with our customers, an inspiring industry, where we use chocolate as a tool for change. An industry where people are placed at the centre of the conversation and where collaboration is at the heart of our efforts.</p>\n<p>Do you want to discover our delicious fine flavour chocolates?

Nor is it a declaration of love. It is a momentous search that I carried out over the last two years for the solution to the most brutal professional challenge that I have come up against. Let me tell you all about it…</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate is a company with over 113 years of history. However, just 10 years ago, we decided to internationalize and take our chocolate across the globe. With our hopes set on this goal, we realized that we had to face new challenges. Selling chocolate to industry and manufacturing final products for other companies is a business that has nothing to do with what we have done for 100 years in Colombia; serving companies instead of end consumers and selling in 42 countries rather than just one, are completely different challenges.</p>\n<p>So when I took on the role of director of manufacturing and subsequently vice president of the supply chain at Luker Chocolate, I was assigned, alongside my team, the mission of drastically raising the level of production fulfilment, satisfying the service guarantee for our customers, stabilizing production costs and designing the expansion plan for the production plant and logistics warehouses, considering the new international market we were facing.</p>\n<p>How could we achieve this? “Increase the efficiency of industrial and logistics operations, regulate inventories and reach the level of service promised to your customers”: voilà you are a COO (Chief Operations Officer) 10/10. Surely you will also have a good cost performance, healthy working capital and, of course, happy customers. More applause, you are the Messi of operations management.</p>\n<p>And what happens if one day this formula fails? What happens when traditional methods do not suffice? What happens when your supply chain does not react to the classic engineering stimuli in all of its different iterations? Welcome to my world.</p>\n<p>I have been immersed in industrial operations for 11 years: many hours of sweat, as many of tears, and few of sleep. An engineering degree, two masters, several diplomas. And all for what? To understand that in the end, we are so infinitely vulnerable, that regardless of everything you know, a machine will have technical problems, the production plant is going to stop and no matter the number of supply and distribution statistical models, someday your customer will end up without your product. We are human, and we are not perfect; we cannot be arrogant enough to think that everything we do is fail-safe.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you what has always kept me standing and looking towards the future: the capacity for transformation of the human spirit. Take my word for it, this is the energy that fills me up every day, that inspires me to see through other people’s eyes, that fills me with happiness on seeing how raw materials become a  with a history that can change someone’s day and make them smile.</p>\n<h3>THE SPIRIT: A NEW FACTOR IN THE EQUATION</h3>\n<p>It was precisely by means of that spirit that I began to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It was clear that innovation in the new model for the Luker Chocolate supply chain had little or nothing to do with numbers, statistical models and continuous improvement methodologies. It was about innovation in productivity from a human and non-technical point of view. It was a blow against a fortified barrier from an unarmoured warrior; it was the spark I was looking for.</p>\n<p>We had to get to work on the task of designing the operation strategy for the entire Luker Chocolate supply chain, and it needed to be fast, effective, but, above all, genuine. It had to be ambitious, we had to dream big, we needed to aim for the stars. What would be expected of a strategy proposal that a whole team of engineers had worked on? What was the result? Raising our people’s spirits. But that was the way it was, we had taken on an enormous task, everybody in the production plants, in the distribution centres and in the administrative offices had to be connected body and soul to our purpose.</p>\n<p>We gave up prioritizing production costs and customer service levels; we had to attend to ourselves first.</p>\n<h3>SOMETHING HAD TO STICK</h3>\n<p>The first step was clear; we had to create an identity. To do this, we initially focused on manufacturing and communicating the three rules of the game ad infinitum: participatory leadership, two-way communication, and leaving a mark.</p>\n<p>Participatory leadership meant delegating workload, it was a way of asking for help from the entire team and telling them that the more people who rowed the boat, the faster it would go. It meant empowering, letting go, accompanying and encouraging. Encouraging and supporting. Less Messis, more teams. Remember that we are vulnerable and we will always need help.</p>\n<p>Two-way communication was not understood to be any different from situations where Directors and Bosses would initiate conversations with their collaborators, or those where the collaborators would take the initiative. Hierarchies are mental, but respect and dialogue are universal. Here the focus was to train ourselves in how to talk. A rather funny anecdote came out of this: my office was nicknamed The Doctor’s Office, as normally from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. conversations arose between collaborators, people who just wanted to dream and improve their way of doing things, but needed the wings to do it.</p>\n<p>Leaving a mark was what the plant workers were achieving with their work; only they did not know it. Behind their effort was a higher purpose that started with The Chocolate Dream and that finally matured in our chocolate becoming a tool for change.</p>\n<p>We had valuable conversations with our people, we were sensitive, empathetic and we opened our doors, because we needed to become obsessed with sensing that positive energy flowed in the production plant, I became obsessed with seeing the day when people would look us in the eye when we talked to them. We listened to the market and applied consumer knowledge techniques, but this time the market was our plant and the consumer each of our white-overalled soldiers who give it their all to really make our chocolate a tool for change.</p>\n<h3>A CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES, THE REDESIGN OF OPERATIONS AND TECHNICAL RIGOUR</h3>\n<p>The rules of the game that I talked about earlier were not enough to overcome the challenge. When it comes to people, we have to rethink methods and technology so that everything progresses in the most harmonious and balanced way possible; management based only on the technical aspects and with soft skills is like food without salt.</p>\n<p>At this point, it was necessary to enlist the entire technical arsenal of operations management to bring changes in methods and technology to the table.</p>\n<p>Regarding the methods, among other things, an aggressive plan to increase efficiency was launched, a plan that had three characteristics: it was practical, easy to understand and very, very technical. Secondly, and perhaps most significantly, was the change in the production plant administration’s entire organizational structure. If we wanted participatory leadership, two-way communication and for our people to leave their mark, the administrative structure should be prepared to manage these practices.</p>\n<p>In technological terms, the Master Plan for Industrial and Logistics Operations was formulated with the objective of doubling the chocolate production capacity and preparing the company’s 5-year technological development path. An 18-month plan was launched; today we only have four months of it left.</p>\n<h3>THE LAST DROP MAKES THE CUP RUN OVER</h3>\n<p>Indeed. If you hammer enough, one of the nails must go in. Surprisingly, like an avalanche, the entire manufacturing system began to react, the level of customer service began to improve, inventories began to regulate themselves, production costs stabilized and people began to smile. As the cherry on the cake, 7 months after the launch of this strategy, the plant achieved record production. Not even in my wildest dreams would I have thought that this was possible.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the best future planning is achieved by looking to the past, and Luker Chocolate’s past and present are imbued with closeness and familiarity, as principles that are tied to our history. We just needed to embrace these two elements and push them forward in a transparent and genuine way, because that is how principles and values should be treated, they can never be used like pawns in a game of chess.</p>\n<p>If you ask me what the innovative element of this story is, I would tell you that it was in taking people out of the classic resource analysis – industrial engineers will know what I mean -. For us, people are not and will never be seen as a resource, they will always be people.</p>\n<p>And how are we doing today? There is still a long way to go, there are so many things that can be improved and, most importantly, there are still conversations to be had. But the journey is more pleasant when small triumphs are celebrated.</p>\n<p>Never forget that “everything burns if you apply enough spark.”</p>\n<p>I present to you the people who worked this magic:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-5.e3d39bad.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Workers\">\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-worker.4139fa73.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa worker\">\n    `,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'CRISTIAN CHU', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHLclm7u9XKIg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=WjGN2LsdE9JD7XbCR7nKbDeK8KEejiW0DF3Qcx4HLZQ', details: 'Supply Chain Vicepresident', description: 'Electronic engineer with more than 10 years of experience in operations management and supply chain in the food and beverage sector.

In this first story, José Maldonado, Sustainable Supply Analyst, tells us about his experience.</p>\n<p>From a very young age, the countryside and I have been inseparable. My paternal grandfather is a veterinarian and has been a milk producer all his life, while my maternal grandfather is a coffee farmer, as were his ancestors for several generations. I’ve always been proud of the Colombian countryside and I’ve identified myself as part of it, so much so that I have often told people that I am from the countryside with my head held high.</p>\n<p>I thought I had a lot of experience, but after spending two weeks accompanying different cocoa farming families in Huila, I realized I couldn’t be more in the wrong. To be from the countryside requires courage and sacrifice, but above all, you need to have a giant heart and be deeply in love with the land and its traditions.</p>\n<p>On this journey, I met many people, but the stories that I am going to tell below belong to people who taught me great life lessons.</p>\n<p>The first was Pedro Nel Córdoba; he met us at the Neiva airport and welcomed us. This Opita with his sung accent is the representative of Luker Chocolate’s Agricultural Development department for Huila, Tolima, Putumayo and Caquetá. There is no supplier, farm or association where he is not greeted with a big hug and like a brother returning home. Pedro knows and understands his land perfectly, because, full of pride, he often recalls that he grew up in the countryside and that his parents raised him and 5 brothers with the produce of 1 hectare of cocoa. He knows what it means to fight and work for a farm that, no matter how small, is the essence and source of life that sustains thousands of farmer families in Colombia.</p>\n<p>The team led by Pedro was ready to embark on our 2-week journey through this beautiful department. We started in the municipality of Rivera, where we visited three families belonging to the Association of Cocoa Producers of the Municipality of Rivera (ASOPROCAR). I was fortunate enough to visit Doña Carmen’s farm, an 82-year-old woman, but with the heart and soul of a 20-year old. She is the matron of her family and is proud to be the head of four generations, but even more so, to see her children succeeding thanks to the life and education she was able to give them with the 3 hectares of cocoa that she worked on for so many years with her late husband.</p>\n<p>Doña Carmen’s house is right next to her cocoa plantation. It is a home full of love and particulars; it is full of Catholic images and photographs with her family. During the visit, we toured all of her plantation and, plant by plant, this woman showed us how hard she works for her cocoa trees and how well she knows them.</p>\n<p>The following day was revelatory, as it was time to harvest and shell the cocoa pods. Two workers were in charge of collecting them and there was also a shelling team, which we were part of. What seemed like a simple task turned out to be exhausting. In an hour, I had to stop twice, stand up, stretch and wait for my back pain to pass. Meanwhile, Doña Carmen, 82, did not complain once and only stopped for lunch. She just laughed when she saw us struggling to complete the task. That’s how I learned about the admirable strength and character of the people of Huila.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was the neighbouring municipality of Campoalegre, the rice capital of Huila. A region with an agricultural vocation, marked by beautiful valleys with different types of crops. In this place, I was particularly marked by a farm in a mountainous area, where coffee is beginning to predominate. There we met Doña Concha, her son Gentil, and the person who would give me a great life lesson: Samuel. This more or less 35-year-old dark-skinned man, with a well-groomed moustache and an infectious joy, has his own corn and coriander crop on the farm and was one of our guides.</p>\n<p>Samuel has been blind for 8 years, but we could not believe it, and it was not because we doubted his word, but because of the way in which he finds his way around the farm. He never gets lost and even walks very dangerous roads all by himself. The most incredible thing about this man is his attitude. At one point, he was asked if it had been very difficult to regain his life after losing his sight, and he quietly replied, “Only a little”.</p>\n<p>After touring Huila, we set out on a road of about 86 kilometres to the south of the department. We travelled along the banks of the Magdalena River and the giant Quimbo Dam until our last destination: Garzón. This municipality is an important coffee-growing centre in Colombia and a great agricultural pantry for the region. It has also become a very important cocoa collection point for Luker Chocolate. This is where I had the most significant encounter and perhaps the one that inspired me the most to continue to work for the cocoa farmers of Colombia.</p>\n<p>On the penultimate day of our journey, we went to the Majo trail to visit Don Ismael’s farm. Don Ismael is approximately 80 years old and native of the region. Our main host was “Chucho”, one of his sons who takes care of him and helps him with the work on the cocoa plantation. We had the opportunity to help them during the working day by collecting the ripe cocoa cobs throughout the morning. It wasn’t until the end of the day, and after enjoying a nice sancocho, that the character that influenced me immensely arrived.</p>\n<p>A 12-year-old boy, redheaded and full of freckles, came in from the back door. He wore knee-length jeans, a white vest, a slingshot across his chest, and rubber boots. He brought a bucket full of small fish he had just caught in a nearby river. He looked like a Colombian Tom Sawyer, an adventurous child; one of those that are in danger of extinction. Without thinking about it, he approached us to show us the catch of the day and began to talk to us about everything he did after school. His name is Wilmer and he’s Don Ismael’s grandson. He took me on a tour to show me his onion crop, some ducks he is raising, and finally, full of pride, he showed me his own cocoa tree. A thought came into my head: “the Colombian countryside does have a great future and it is because of children like him that we must continue to work”.</p>\n<p>Wilmer is an enterprising and curious child. At a very early age, he began to help his mother, as their father left them when he was just a baby. But this never stopped him. His way of seeing life, of appreciating agriculture, his desire to get ahead and the way he helps his family, marked me in an indescribable way.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JOSÉ MALDONADO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGWmXeWsufD9Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=sPc6xh78N7oYmS61XLxym_XcKLYzzBJ9PSp5kyFCPQk', details: 'SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY ANALYST', description: 'Sustainable Supply Analyst for Luker Chocolate, focused on agricultural development and sustainability projects of the company\\'s value chain.Project leader for organizations of cocoa producers and small- scale farmers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-miguel-maldonado-v%C3%A9lez-79a818114/', 'Jose Maldonado']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DECEMBER 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AUGUST 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULY 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/create-shared-value', name: 'Create shared value' }],\n    url: 'cacao-fino-de-aroma-colombias-cultural-and-historical-heritage',\n    title: 'CACAO FINO DE AROMA: COLOMBIA’S CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL HERITAGE',\n    cover: 'banner-cacaos.jpg',\n    date: 'JULY 2019',\n    content: `<p>Today, after having developed a success story around Colombian Cacao Fino de Aroma throughout the world, and opening a market not only for Luker Chocolate but for all the country’s cocoa farmers, we want to go back and think about the road traveled, analyse the present, and think about what will come next.</p>\n<p>One of our most important advantages, which has been difficult to replicate by other companies in the world, is our ability -developed over more than 100 years- to play with the different types of cocoa available to maintain consistency in the taste of chocolate, day after day and year after year, so that our customers can always enjoy the very best Colombian chocolate. To make drinking chocolate like Luker Tradicional, one of the products in our Colombian portfolio that is made 100% of cocoa liquor, and to ensure that it maintains its flavour through the years, is something that is still difficult to believe by many of our competitors, who know that the flavour of cocoa changes slightly in each harvest.</p>\n<p>To tell you how we have achieved this consistent flavour, we must go back to 2004 – 2005, where we see Luker Chocolate as a local company beginning to think about the world and about the right strategy to internationalize as a global business. It was then that we began to deepen our knowledge of Colombian cocoa of which we already had the flavour identified and standardised according to the country’s main regions, and we sought the help of CENICAFE to conduct a scientific study to allow us to design a strategy based on the flavour of the cocoa and our ability to develop mixtures that preserve the flavour that we were promising.</p>\n<p>In these first phases of our international business, it was scientifically proven that the cocoa from Santander, Tumaco, and Huila had the flavour characteristics necessary to define origin cocoa with its own personality and sufficient differentiation and volume to build an international expansion strategy. At the same time, we realized that there was an organization called ICCO (International Cocoa Organization), which had a clear definition for special cocoas, known as CACAO FINO DE AROMA. This is a cocoa free of taste defects, with a complex sensory profile that reflects not only the experience of those harvest it, but also the environment where it was grown, fermented and dried. A Cacao Fino de Aroma that has these criteria, also offers an important genetic diversity, as well as a historical and cultural heritage, and this was exactly what we believed of our Colombian cocoa; a cocoa that reflects the work of our country’s farmers, showing their culture and history, and that stands as a symbol of economic development and social transformation in the Colombian countryside. The difference is that it was beginning to be recognized worldwide.</p>\n<p>At that time, one way to demonstrate that the cocoa was indeed Fino de Aroma was through the theobromine/caffeine ratio, which was used as a discerning factor to differentiate between Forastero, Trinitario and Criollo Cocoa (the first one being related to common cocoa and the latter to special cocoa) by discerning between their aroma and taste characteristics. It is worth specifying that while the level of theobromine is similar in all cocoas, the more Latin American in origin the cocoa, the higher the caffeine.</p>\n<p>All these antecedents, organized by a team of visionaries determined to do something different, allowed us to design and implement an expansion strategy based on the flavour of Cacao Fino de Aroma, sustained by years of experience in chocolate making, deep agricultural knowledge developed on the Luker Chocolate Granja, and a strong relationship with small cocoa farmers in our country.</p>\n<p>In these 15 years of history, we have increased our scientific knowledge of our Cacao Fino de Aroma, we have developed new origins and more are on the way. We can now clearly define the physicochemical characteristics of cocoa from some 40 regions of the country. Technical parameters such as vitamin and mineral content, antioxidants and polyphenols, structure of triglycerides present or theobromine/caffeine ratio, is information that can be used for the design of almost any type of chocolate that our customers require, always preserving the flavour characteristics that we can control. We continue to maintain our ability to manufacture the drinking chocolate that Colombian consumers like, while also developing a portfolio of chocolates for the world’s professional market. More than 100 recipes or mixtures of cocoa and other ingredients enable us to have an unsurpassable offer of chocolates made with Cacao Fino de Aroma.</p>\n<p>The list of countries that export Cacao Fino de Aroma total or partially is made up today of 25 countries according to the decision made by the panel of experts at the last ICCO meeting in Abidjan on April 13, 2019. The panel of experts is made up of 10 people, 5 from non-producer countries and 5 from producer countries, of which we are part, and is responsible for recommending to the ICCO, the qualification to be given based on the guidelines established in the International Cocoa Agreement. According to historical information, the list of countries was reviewed in the years 1972, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1993, 2001, 2010, 2015 and 2019.  Colombia appeared as a partial exporter of Cacao Fino de Aroma in 1993. In 2008, it was included by the panel in the list of countries with 100% compliance, and in 2010 this was raised to 95%, a figure that has been maintained ever since.</p>\n<p>We are delving deeper into the world of flavour, developing new varieties of cocoa that offer very interesting profiles, while increasing the productivity of our crops and the cocoa regions where we work. We are exploring new technologies that will allow us to perfect and standardize the fermentation and drying processes, in order to continue to offer the best chocolates made with Colombian Cacao Fino de Aroma to the whole world.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'FRANCISCO GÓMEZ', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFWyb8DSqYCCg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=dVNW6XiYzO1lK7W9iY9iwua1HVNapQh8khqRdM0Ibto', details: 'Innovation and Business Development Vice-president', description: 'Civil Engineer with more than 30 years of experience in food industries, extensive knowledge in the cocoa supply chain and development of international markets.

Among our cocoa farmers, we have 70 workers from Caribia, a small village that is part of the subregion of Urabá, Antioquia, Colombia.</p>\n<p>For some time now, its inhabitants began to train as technicians in sustainable tourism and voiced their enthusiasm towards turning their village into a touristic destination, taking advantage of its historical wealth —it was the first settlement in the area and had a tremendous ethnic diversity—. This was an excellent opportunity to support the Caribia community by helping them spread to the world the energy and generosity their people carry in their hearts, and their relentless desire to move forward. We were thrilled to display that inner beauty into the community, by transforming Caribia into a vibrant touristic destination. With this grand challenge on our hands, Luker Chocolate recruited happy volunteers to paint the Caribia dream in colors, and this is how Pinta Caribia was born.</p>\n<p>For us Pinta Caribia is more than just an initiative, it is the tangible metaphor and magical realism that exists around the cocoa pod, that not only nurtures the beans but also nurtures lives and builds dreams around it.  With our hearts filled with empathy and lots of excitement, the sustainability team of The Chocolate Dream started to materialize the execution of Pinta Caribia.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-7.4768f7ff.jpg\" alt=\"Pinta caribean girls\">\n<p>This is how we got in touch with the Orbis-Pintuco Foundation (organization with experience generating development through education and color in vulnerable populations throughout Colombia) and together we saw the potential of doing an artistic day in which volunteers from Luker Chocolate and inhabitants of Caribia would paint as a team until the last house of the village.</p>\n<p>The Orbis-Pintuco Foundation helped us to create a program in which 20 young people from Caribia applied to be trained as technicians in painting. Now we only needed the materials, because we had to collect 500 gallons of paint. Between the Orbis Pintuco Foundation, Luker Chocolate and its collaborators, we collected donations to reach the goal. Additionally, 30 of our collaborators, including the management committee, travelled as volunteers to participate in Pinta Caribia, the name we decided to put on this initiative and work shoulder to shoulder with the workers of our farm.</p>\n<h3>PAINTING A DREAM</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-8.b85e34a1.jpg\" alt=\"Girl painting\">\n<p>And the big day finally arrived, on June 22nd, more than 30 volunteers and Caribans united their efforts around the dream of turning Caribia into the most colorful place in Necoclí. The palette was carefully selected to represent the colors found in the cultivation of cocoa, colors that for the Caribia population have a deep meaning: blue symbolizing tranquility, green representing the peace found in the village, yellow representing the prosperity achieved in the cocoa fields and red for the love they have for their community and families.</p>\n<p>Each volunteer helped two families to paint their houses while receiving assistance from the inhabitants who had previously been trained by the Orbis-Pintuco Foundation. Also, the community was responsible for preparing breakfast, lunch and food, thus concretizing great teamwork and strengthening the links between Luker Chocolate and the community.</p>\n<p>Shoulder to shoulder, despite the heat and exhaustion, we worked for a common goal and this effort was reflected in the results: 100 houses were painted that day, from the primary school, community center, nursery, to the playgrounds.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/growing-comunity.598f55e2.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa community\">\n<p>The Chocolate Dream colors covered more than 100 houses in the small town, and these colors tell the story of how dreaming together and working together can make dreams a beautiful reality. Today we want to thank the community of Caribia for allowing us to connect with their dreams, open the doors of their homes and let us fill their lives with color and chocolate; without a doubt, they also painted our hearts. </p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'SARA GALEANO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHmeKp3KisJdQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=grUKZd2SlKyWPgqFHw1IBrNHv31uaLPa6K73hx7A_r8', details: 'Brand & Communications Professional', description: 'Social Communicator of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana with emphasis on advertising and complementary matters in organizational.

We pray for those who do not have enough to eat, for the sick, for prisoners, and the kidnapped. We thank you for the opportunity to meet here today and for the presence of these doctors and engineers who have come to help us progress, to improve our countryside, our farms, and our lives. Amen</q>.  Prayer of Don Jesús, cocoa farmer in Huila.\n<p>Standing with his eyes closed, and holding hands with the people around him, this was the prayer that Jesus Augusto Gomez uttered aloud before inviting us to the table. The chicken sancocho had been prepared on a wood-burning stove as you could tell by its smoky taste, by the smell of wood in the air, and by the smoke blowing out from Doña Elvira Quintero de Gómez roof. The table was laid with a classic hand-woven tablecloth, very typical of Colombian peasant houses, with plates from different sets collected over the years and cutlery of different styles and shapes. The soup, the main course and a delicious agua de panela were arranged in each one of the 8 carefully placed spaces at Doña Elvira’s wooden table. In total, there were 11 of us, so after the prayer, Don Jesus, his wife Doña Elvira, and their son “El Mono”, moved to let the guests sit down and have lunch first. He said we were the priority. In spite of having worked all morning on his farm harvesting cocoa under the Huila sun (Colombia), and at the age of 75, he refused to sit down as a gesture of hospitality.</p>\n<p>The four of us from Bogotá were, in fact, complete strangers to this cocoa family. We had asked the associations ASOPROCAR and ASOPECA to take us to visit a farm in the region, because we wanted to learn about their reality, live in their environment for a few hours, and spend time with them for no other reason than to listen to what they had to tell us.</p>\n<p>I have to confess that when we arrived in Huila, I had no clear idea of how they were going to receive us. I thought that our visit would make them suspicious because it’s not a common thing to do. We had arrived suddenly hoping to get into a family’s personal space for an entire day in exchange for nothing. I thought they would refuse to receive us or ask us what we were really there for. What would happen if you suddenly arrive at a house in Bogotá and asked to stay there all day? To my surprise, we were greeted with a big smile and a contagious kindness.</p>\n<p>After a short conversation to welcome us and to show us around the place, we went out into the 3-hectare cocoa plantation with very tall, old trees, with thick trunks, a typical characteristic of the area’s very traditional agriculture and practices. Don Jesus was walking with some difficulty, as he had an accident when he was young that injured his leg. He didn’t complain, but we could see that it was difficult for him to walk. He then told us that he had had five strokes, but that he was still working as usual. During the tour, he spontaneously told us anecdotes about his life. To the left of the path where we walked, there was a ravine with crystalline water, with huge stones and leafy vegetation. The shade of the cocoa trees and the sound of the ravine made for a cosy atmosphere that served as the backdrop for a conversation of about 2 hours. We learned about how Don Jesus managed his estate. Although he did not know for sure how much he produced, nor did he have any figures written down, he knew his trees like the palm of his hand.</p>\n<p>After lunch where we were treated with so much hospitality, we spent time with the family who taught us how to prepare guarapo, a typical Colombian drink made with sugar cane juice. In the courtyard, they had an old cane-chopping machine. “El Mono” had already cut some of these plants that were ready to be put through the machine to extract the juice. We all helped, and in the end, obtained about 5 liters of guarapo. Tired out by the afternoon activity, we went to the kiosk where Don Orlando, leader of the cocoa association, who works with Don Jesus, invited for a brandy after dinner.</p>\n<p>At the kiosk, Don Jesus told us more stories about his life, one of them about his leg accident. He told us that at the age of 20, he was chasing a girl he liked. One night, he wanted to go out on his horse to look for her. His mother warned him not to go out, that it was too late and that it was not the right thing to do. He went out anyway and fell from his horse, which almost left him disabled. The moral he had to share with us, in the end, was: “A mother always knows what’s best for you. Always listen to your parents”. Just then, Guillermo Valderrama, our 65-year-old-consultant, added, “That’s right, he who doesn’t listen to his mother, doesn’t listen to God’s voice”.</p>\n<p>He also told us about how he had stopped drinking alcohol in his old age, thus losing many of his friends. He told us about his childhood secrets and his indelible memories of the era of bipartisan violence between liberals and conservatives – two Colombian political parties – during the 1950s. He told us how he saw many people die near the farm where he grew up and about the recent violence. At 75, he recounted these memories as if they had happened yesterday. His trauma was evident, but his conviction for the value of work, the countryside, agriculture, and peaceful community life was also strong.</p>\n<p>As we were about to leave, “El Mono”, who had a mental disorder due to having drunk adulterated alcohol and who had been feeling depressed and lonely lately, told us: “thanks to your visit, my farm looks even more beautiful to me today”. Today has been an amazing and happy day for me. I learned more things than on any other day in the Bogotá office; I spoke with more empathy; I was more at peace; more human; happier; I hugged people I had never seen before; I enjoyed the tranquillity of the countryside; I met people who, despite not having been able to finish high school, knew more than I did; I was once again aware of the value of our countryside and of the human quality and drive of our peasants.</p>\n<p>At Luker Chocolate, we will continue to work with them and for them, because it is they who make it possible for us to enjoy the food the earth gives us.</p>\n<p>Those two weeks I spent with cocoa farmers in Huila marked my life as very few other things had. Pedro, Doña Carmen, Samuel, and Wilmer made me see that life in the countryside is very different from what I had experienced; it is more challenging, yes, but just as it challenges the land also inspires passion. It reconnects you with your roots and makes you grateful for the little things in life. For this reason, I want to continue to work towards developing the Colombian countryside through cocoa; I want to dignify the life of the farmers of my country and, above all, I dream of the day when all farmer children can have a quality future, so that their dream is to stay and work in the countryside and change the reality of our country.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'SERGIO RESTREPO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEU_fSBYnqwnw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=pqJb74EtssHW43ajcC8aeRAErFY_wdDFWW8NCbfjXzE', details: 'Marketing Vice-president', description: 'I see chocolate as a tool of change.

Forest plantations in Colombia have been used for commercial purposes and as strategic tools for the restoration of degraded soils and the conservation of water resources; however, the effect of forest plantations on local diversity has been insufficiently evaluated, especially in the role they play as habitats for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity (Haggar et al., 1997, Barlow et al., 2007, Mitra and Sheldon 1993). In the case of Luker Chocolate, we have implemented agroforestry systems both on Granja Luker and on our cocoa farms in Necoclí (550 ha) and Casanare (1,000 ha), thus promoting biodiversity and an optimal environment for the conservation of autochthonous fauna and flora.</p>\n<p>But how do we measure the biodiversity we promote with our crops? Birds are used as an indicator of a region’s biodiversity because their abundance and occurrence is influenced by the characteristics and composition of the habitat with which they are associated, because they are relatively easy to observe, and they can be counted at large scales (GREGORY, 2006); RAMÍREZ-ALBORES AND RAMÍREZ-CEDILLO, 2002). Only in our cocoa forest in Necocli, there are 96 different bird species, almost 10% of the total number of birds reported in Colombia.</p>\n<p>At Granja Luker, we measure biodiversity not only based on the presence of birds but also on the many other species that inhabit the crop’s ecosystem and that, in time, have become cocoa friends. Here are some of my most memorable anecdotes involving some of them.</p>\n<p>On my first day of work, I decided to tour the farm with Peggy. As we walked, she started barking and frantically chasing after a group of birds. As I got closer, I realized that these animals were not in the cocoa field by chance; on the contrary, they were setting traps on the cocoa fruits to attract insects that would become their food.</p>\n<p>Little by little, the day progressed, and it was soon time for lunch. In an ordinary office, lunchtime is usually a time to interact with our colleagues, and although that was what I was hoping for, it was not the case, since my colleagues were a little different. As I approached the dining room -to which the herd of dogs had come too- 1 km away from the main house, I came across chickens that were also looking for food, as well as a couple of hungry ducks and a parrot that shouted “quiere cacao?”.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-2.5bfa3000.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa friend parrot\">\n<p>A month later, I went to gather fruit with the farmworkers under a completely clear sky; the day was sunny, and I felt that nothing wrong could happen. But all of a sudden, I felt as though I was being electrocuted. I started screaming and the workers, used to such things, told me to take my shirt off because I was being stung by tiny wasps. I listened to them and managed to get rid of the insects, but then I decided to go back to see what had stung me, only to get stung again. I had been warned that in life one has both good and bad bosses, that some of them may even be moody, but I do not think that anyone has been so severely judged by a boss as I was by those wasps; surely that was their way of telling me that I had to be more respectful of their home.</p>\n<p>The ecosystem at La Granja also includes some white worms that are colloquially called gusano pollo or chicken worms and that appear at certain times of the year. The first time I heard about them was when a farmer was pruning the trees, and one of these worms bit him and left him with a fever all day long. These animals are very common and go unnoticed as they feed on the leaves and live below them.</p>\n<p>One day, everything was suddenly completely different. As we crossed a guadua bridge, we came across a small friend who could be terrifying for some people and fascinating for others: a snake found in some trees near a creek that crosses through the farm. When we saw it, I panicked and decided to move away a little, but it was used to seeing humans and didn’t get upset. One of the workers took it in his hands to take pictures of her, as it was one of the “pets” that belonged to the farm and, as they are often killed in the region, this one was being protected by the workers. After the photo was taken, the worker put it back in its den, while I recovered from the shock!</p>\n<p>Finally, I will never forget the day when one of the workers saw something tiny moving in the bushes and decided to take a look. It was a baby squirrel that had lost its mother, so he took it to the farm, took care of it himself, and protected it from predators. In time, the squirrel decided to go its own way, but it often comes back to visit the worker that helped it as a baby, or to eat cocoa cobs!</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the many species that live here and show how a cocoa crop can become a sanctuary for hundreds of coexisting vertebrate and invertebrate animals, from possums, armadillos, guatines, dogs, cats, ducks, rabbits, to snakes and insects. They have to be protected and cared for because they perform a task that is way more important than anything we can do: they maintain a balance of populations and the biodiversity of an entire ecosystem. While they do such an outstanding job, I, who remained working at Granja as an agricultural analyst, will continue to let them walk with me and fill my days with greater meaning.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JUAN JOSÉ HINCAPIÉ', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQF3R8cD2WhDyw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=1h2n3IYyHMZm-VA4MHb0bko7VW_XLXAFZnoyRIqj334', details: 'Agricultural Analyst', description: 'Agricultural Analyst at Luker Chocolate', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-jos%C3%A9-hincapi%C3%A9-toro-b18a12181/', 'Juan José Hincapié']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DECEMBER 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AUGUST 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULY 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/what-you-didnt-know', name: 'What you didn’t know' }],\n    url: 'a-chocolate-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away',\n    title: 'A CHOCOLATE A DAY, KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY',\n    cover: 'finished-product-title.jpg',\n    date: 'AUGUST 2019',\n    content: `<p>Few people are aware of the great benefits of regular cocoa consumption; the vast majority of consumers are convinced (some by medical recommendations) that cocoa and/or chocolate are harmful to health. In order to solve this dispute, Luker Chocolate’s research area, in association with research centres in Colombia and Italy (University of Molise – Campo Basso, Sannio Tech – Benevento, and University of Brescia), characterised the cocoa from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and for over four years have developed a variety of experimental designs, including preclinical and clinical studies with 50 volunteers. Once the results were obtained, we discussed them with a group formed by the most renowned cardiologists, nutritionists, nutritionists, dermatologists, sportsmen, etc.</p>\n<p>Today, we have enough scientific and technical evidence to be able to assert that regular consumption of cocoa helps to improve and protect people’s health. But how much chocolate should we consume? Our recommendation is two servings of chocolate powder a day or one of dark chocolate for at least one month. This will help you to:</p>\n<h3>PROTECT YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH</h3>\n<p>Consuming cocoa helps reduce total cholesterol and bad cholesterol (LDL), while increasing good cholesterol (HLD) and reducing or regulating the omega 6 and omega 3 ratio, helping to improve your heart health and decreasing the risks of such diseases. Your heart will become even stronger if, as well as consuming cocoa, you begin to acquire healthy lifestyle habits in your diet by decreasing the consumption of animal fats and carbs, while increasing your consumption of pulses and vegetables. We also recommend that you do some physical exercises such as walking up to 10,000 steps a day.</p>\n<h3>PROTECT GASTRIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL HEALTH</h3>\n<p>Cocoa contains fibre (insoluble and soluble) that helps to improve bowel movement and eliminate toxins from the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. These types of fibre have a prebiotic characteristic that feed probiotic microorganisms that maintain gastric health. It is important to remember that immune health is largely conditioned by gastric health; unfortunately many people have gastric problems due to the low intake of fibre from pulses and vegetables.</p>\n<p>Tip: eat chocolate and vegetables daily, and you will notice how your gastric and immune health improves.</p>\n<h3>IMPROVE YOUR MOOD</h3>\n<p>Cocoa has molecules that act as neurotransmitters of messages in the central nervous system. One of these is phenylethylamine, better known as the molecule of love. It has been proven that the brain of a person in love contains large amounts of this substance that could be responsible for certain sensations such as excitement, tachycardia, and redness, among others. This neurotransmitter triggers the action of other neurotransmitters called happiness molecules such as serotonin (generates a feeling of self-love and respect for others), oxytocin (generates a feeling of love for others and affective bonding), and dopamine (generates joy and a feeling of euphoria).</p>\n<p>Tip: don’t make life bitter, take it easy and drink chocolate, the antidepressant par excellence. It really works.</p>\n<h3>PRODUCING OR ACTIVATING THE BODY’S ENERGY SYSTEMS</h3>\n<p>Yes, consuming cocoa helps to produce energy or activate the existing energy in the body. Its potassium content and the activation of important proteins in the process of energy production, make cocoa a key morning food that will help you stay energised throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Best of all, it doesn’t contain excessive doses of caffeine.</p>\n<h3>MAINTAIN THE OVERALL HEALTH</h3>\n<p>This looks like a phrase taken from a youtuber’s video. It seems incredible or a little daring to claim. Let me explain. When we breathe or expose ourselves to the sun, our body releases substances that oxidise it and that are very reactive and dangerous. They are called free radicals and are incomplete molecules that go looking around our body for electrons to attach to. These radicals are the cause of the vast majority of chronic non-communicable diseases that cause the most deaths in the world, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. Although our body produces its own antioxidants that quickly neutralise those free radicals or oxidising substances, stress, irregular mealtimes, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, and not exercising decrease the production of natural antioxidants and free radicals begin to take over. In other words, bad habits make us rusty! Fortunately there are foods like tea, grapes, blueberries and especially chocolate, which bring levels of antioxidants to the body preventing this from happening. In the specific case of cocoa, it has a substance called NFR2, which is a protein that reactivates the genes that produce our own antioxidant substances, further increasing the protection against chronic non-communicable diseases.</p>\n<p>Cocoa also possesses significant quantities of minerals that promote the development of biological reactions, such as potassium, which plays a role in energy production and regulates the heart rate; calcium, which helps transmit nerve impulses as well as protecting against osteoporosis; iron, which helps fight anaemia; and zinc, which helps the immune system, the cognitive development of children and the maturation and maintenance of sexual activity over the years.</p>\n    `,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'HUGO OLARTE', avatar: '', details: 'Investigation and Special Projects Manager', description: 'Dir I&D en Casa Luker', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-olarte-83625568/', 'Hugo Olarte']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DECEMBER 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AUGUST 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULY 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/take-stand', name: 'Take a stand' }],\n    url: 'healing-with-art-part-one',\n    cover: 'healing-with-art.jpg',\n    title: 'HEALING WITH ART: Part one',\n    date: 'SEPTEMBER 2019',\n    content: `<p><small><b>Editor’s note:</b> Last year, we worked with Transhuella in an artistic project that gathered painting and photography to recognise the cultural heritage of the surrounding communities of our cocoa forest in Necocli.

There is a story of tradition and success of innovation and belonging, a story of responsibility that only few know.</p>\n<p>A company with a large portfolio of products, sufficient to supply everything that a home needs, to give life and colour to our corner shops. In Colombia, we don’t have to go very far to buy what we need and say hello to our neighbours on the way.</p>\n<p>There is a star product with a unique flavour that hypnotises people in the several blocks surrounding the main offices in main cities such as Bogotá: the smell of COCOA.</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate has built the backbone of its social responsibility programme based on cocoa, a programme that has been recognised and praised globally.</p>\n<p>Social responsibility or shared value are synonyms for tax exemption and marketing campaigns that show the friendly side of companies. This is what we perceive as common citizens, as an excuse for companies that, rather than helping those in their area of impact and giving back to society what they’ve achieved, are only interested in reducing their taxes.</p>\n<p>However, at Transhuella we know that the majority want to do the right thing and act with a social conscience; the majority produce with the intention of giving back all that Colombian society and its land has given us.</p>\n<p>This is why we have embarked on this task with those who are willing to open their doors to show what there is behind each of their products: the love and their commitment to their origin and their society.</p>\n<p>Sustainable companies are about understanding that the workers, employees, raw material, and surroundings are as important as their owners.</p>\n<p>Does social responsibility not imply involving other people to make them fall in love with the meaning behind an individual effort turned common cause? In society, responsibility is shared; we all have something to contribute.</p>\n<p>To our surprise, there is a team behind this great brand thinking not about how to show society its contribution (beyond the daily energy their chocolate gives us) but rather, about how to have an impact on the lives of those who make the Chocolate Dream come true.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/nina.9b48b347.jpg\" alt=\"girl\">\n<p>Mother and daughter, Rosalba and Silvia, say that Luker Chocolate is synonymous to blessings and opportunities.

A company that embarked on developing its business hand-in-hand with the community that surrounds its cocoa plantations in Necoclí, and not only those who work with them directly.</p>\n<p>Without doubt, the presence of Luker Chocolate has given this community life and has driven its dreams, even for those who are not directly related to the company.</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate takes risks when it builds the country; it is an example for the Colombian business sector.</p>\n<p>It’s true that chocolate is celebrated around the world… But only a magical place can understand the importance of celebrating the fruit from which this food is produced, a sweet, a product with as many facets and uses as the variety in its colours.</p>\n<p>Caribia has 438 inhabitants, 438 voices that sing at the Cocoa Festival’s dawn ceremony:</p>\n<q>Viene que ya viene, viene el Festival, Crece la cosecha vamo’ a celebrar<br>\n<i>Viene que ya viene, viene el Festival se unen las familias, todas por igual.</i></q>\n<q>The Festival is coming, coming, it is coming.

It is a subject everyone talks about: experts, non-experts, young people, adults, business people, and government officials. Some place special emphasis on environmental issues; others, on social, economic issues; and others still, on the relationships between all the components. There are great discussions about what it means, or rather, about the paths we must trace as a planet in order to be sustainable. Concepts, interests, cultures, etc. come up against each other, but we all seem to agree that it is a matter of temporariness. How do we meet today’s needs without compromising tomorrow’s? The United Nations managed to get the whole world to look in the same direction: the Sustainable Development Goals that marked out a path that we must follow as humanity in order to live with dignity, guaranteeing resources for future generations.</p>\n<p>UNITED NATIONS MANAGED TO GET THE WHOLE WORLD TO LOOK IN THE SAME DIRECTION: THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THAT MARKED OUT A PATH THAT WE MUST FOLLOW AS HUMANITY IN ORDER TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY, GUARANTEEING RESOURCES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.</p>\n<p>However, although the objectives are now clearer, we still face the challenge of their implementation: who, when, where, and how much money is needed? The discussion then takes a nuance between the practical and the philosophical, between the higher purpose that we as humans have and the will to carry it out. Questions arise as to who should start, whether to start from the bottom or whether it is the responsibility of the leaders. There are more questions about sustainability than there are answers, and there is an especially relevant one: who are the most critical players in making it a reality?</p>\n<p>This is where the very classic discussion between the public sector and the private sector and their role in all this appears. The approach to the role that each must play is preceded by an even more complicated one: is it possible to talk about sustainability in these sectors? In the public sector, for example, there are some limitations to the possibility of being sustainable. A few of them may be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The periods of administration of the Executive Branch (four years) are insufficient for long-term projects to be developed in a sustained manner.</li>\n<li>The overload of the country’s regulations does not allow for progress and flexibility in the execution of public resources in order to make them economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable.</li>\n<li>Building on what has been built has not been a pillar of governance of the public sector so that each time we start again, and the projects are unable to reach their capacity for transformation.</li>\n<li>Public policies, which are the tool that allows good practices to be maintained over time, are not executed rigorously. Their budget continues to depend on the scope that the incumbent wants to give them; thus, they can become invisible to the point of disappearing.</li>\n<li>Regulation around environmental issues is still not rigorous enough, not even for the public sector itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The private sector is also limited in being fully responsible in its economic, environmental, and social sustainability practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The technological development available to generate savings and efficiencies is still insufficient or in some cases, very costly.</li>\n<li>There are difficulties in finding sustainable allies throughout the value chain that adapt to the needs of the sector.</li>\n<li>The training of business leaders has not been focused on sustainability, which suggests a limit to the massive corporate changes that are required for their development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can, therefore, be said that both sectors find significant limitations in the challenge of guaranteeing the resources of future generations and in acting in a fully environmentally and socially responsible manner. However, there is a possibility of reducing these limitations and instead of using the strengths of both sectors that have not been fully explored.</p>\n<p>This possibility implies, first of all, deconstructing the idea that the sustainability of each sector can only be developed in isolation. Humanity cannot live in dignity in the future if each sector tugs at its own side and strives to generate transformations alone. The only way out is to connect, to network, to articulate and to come together as human beings, regardless of where we are.</p>\n<p>The public sector cannot be sustainable without the private; the private sector cannot be sustainable without the public, but to this formula, I suggest adding two new fundamental actors: academia and the community, the other two major players.</p>\n<p>It is only by aligning efforts between these sectors that it will be possible to speak of sustainability since each of them has unique, indispensable, and irreplaceable characteristics that end up being the key pieces for the construction of sustainable cities, countries, and planet.</p>\n<p>To be able to work together, we must create systems, tools, methodologies, look for common ground and, fundamentally, before any development that allows articulation, we must, as human beings who compose these sectors, leave our ego to one side, leave our comfort zone, be willing to work with different people, break with the stereotypes of different sectors and think empathetically.</p>\n<q>THE PUBLIC SECTOR CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE PRIVATE; THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE PUBLIC, BUT TO THIS FORMULA, I SUGGEST ADDING TWO NEW FUNDAMENTAL ACTORS: ACADEMIA AND THE COMMUNITY, THE OTHER TWO MAJOR PLAYERS.</q>\n<p>This is already possible, efforts have already been made to make this happen, and there are already examples of successes. However, it is still on a small scale. The call is for us to think as one, to be able, for the first time, to give up everything we have been building around individuality so that we can maintain and continue to improve our country and our planet. We have already shown that the path of sectorisation has not resulted in us becoming more sustainable; it is time for us to choose to work together for all humanity. Time is running out.</p>\n    `,\n    autor: { name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.

In order to bring a chocolate couverture to life, fermented and dried cocoa beans are selected, winnowed, roasted, ground, mixed (with other ingredients), refined and finally conched, which is what we will deal within this article.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conching-process.cac06e80.jpg\" alt=\"conching process\">\n    <p>The conching process was discovered in 1879 by the Swiss chocolate-maker Rudolph Lindt, who left a mixer containing chocolate running overnight by mistake, and realized that this changed its flavour and texture. The name of the equipment, the conche, is derived from the Latin word ‘shell’, as the traditional conche used in chocolate manufacture resembled a shell.</p>\n<p>Nowadays the conching process is the final step in the manufacture of chocolate, whether its milk or dark, and it is an essential process that contributes to the development of viscosity, final texture, and especially flavour. In the chocolate-making process, in the industry, we talk about ‘cocoa solids’ as particles that carry all the colour, taste, and most of the nutritional value of a chocolate bar, but these particles also happen to have intense bitter and astringent notes, which are given by polyphenols or antioxidants in cocoa, and some other off-flavours such as acetic acid left over from the fermentation process.</p>\n<p>This processing step, which consists mainly of mixing, shearing, and aeration of the chocolate mass at a certain temperature and for a certain amount of time that will be discussed further, is considered a critical step for two main reasons:</p>\n<p>During conching, the tiny particles of solids (cocoa, sugar and milk if is the case) acquire a more uniform shape, to be coated evenly with cocoa butter (continuous phase), which is going to give the chocolate its viscosity, flow and textural properties and determine the way in which the finished product will melt smoothly in the mouth.</p>\n<p>The conching process promotes flavour development through several factors such as time, temperature and the other ingredients in the recipe, but it also removes moisture and volatile off-flavours (short-chained volatile fatty acids and aldehydes) that are highly related with the origin and characteristics of the cocoa beans. This is one of the most relevant reasons for which the conching process at Luker Chocolate is different from other chocolate manufacturing companies.</p><p>Among the scientific community, different researchers put forward different opinions on how many phases there are in the conching process. Some researchers defined conching as a two-phase process. In the first stage known as dry-phase, the moisture level is reduced, some volatile acids like acetic acid caused by cocoa fermentation are removed, and the surfaces of all solid particles are covered with fat. In the second stage, called wet-phase, homogenous and paste-like fluid mass is obtained by adding more cocoa butter and emulsifiers.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some say that this process has three phases, which we actually perform at Luker Chocolate, and that can be described as follows:</p>\n<h3>1. DRY PHASE</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-seco.c303fd51.jpg\" alt=\"Dry phase\">\n<p>The chocolate mass is transferred from the refiner, generally as flakes, to be heated, mixed and aerated. The primary objective of this stage is to allow the evaporation of some of the volatile acids from cocoa liquor and the water originating from the chocolate components. The total concentration of acetic acid after the dry conching stage remains approximately constant as there is no free water that acts as a vapour carrier.</p>\n<h3>2. PLASTIC PHASE</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-plastico.196668e1.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic phase\">\n<p>The mass which was mixed, sheared, heated and degassed enters this second phase that we call the ‘long step’, where flavour characteristics are developed through chemical reactions (Maillard reaction and Strecker’s degradation) given by the process’ time and temperature conditions, and because of major volatilisation of acetic acid due to cocoa fermentation. It is called ‘plastic’ because of the physical change that occur in the mass turning the flakes into a paste and becoming more liquid as the cocoa butter covers the solid particles. Time and temperature play a key role in this stage. The temperature in particular is more closely related to the type of chocolate being manufactured (dark, milk or white), while the time has to do with factors beyond the type of chocolate, where the quality and variety of beans used to produce the cocoa liquor are extremely relevant.</p>\n<h3>3. LIQUID PHASE</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-liquido.b89fdaad.jpg\" alt=\"Liquid phase\">\n<p>This phase is the shortest and it is where the viscosity and flow properties undergo the last adjustments with the addition of cocoa butter and emulsifiers.</p>\n<p>Stating the fact that the type of technology is extremely important (i.e., actual conching machinery designs are more efficient in terms of energy and time) in the conching process during the plastic phase, normally milk chocolates are conched at around 50°C to prevent the caramelisation of the product which occurs above this temperature with the consequent formation of lumps that will be perceived as sandiness in the mouth. Some dark chocolates, on the other hand, can be conched up to 90°C because of their more intense load of volatile by-products from fermentation. However conching time is a big discussion point at this stage, because it is here that the quality, type and the origin of the beans are going to play a determinant role.</p>\n<p>Throughout the years,Luker Chocolate has built an extremely close relationship with the Colombian farmers, sharing knowledge and experience, in order to guarantee and maintain exceptional quality characteristics by the end of the fermentation and drying of the cocoa beans. With this, and considering that the Colombian ‘Fino de Aroma’ cocoa beans are naturally complex in their flavour profile with delicate fruity, floral, and herbal notes, we take great care in the application of temperature and conching time for every chocolate couverture we produce, so that we can deliver finished products to customers all around the world bringing our final consumer a different flavour experience.</p>\n<p>Here at Luker Chocolate, with state-of-art technology and our Colombian Fine Flavour cocoa beans, our conching process ranges from 2 to 7 hours, and this time is what really makes us different in terms of processing conditions. Other companies around the world that manufacture chocolate couvertures, working with bulk cocoa beans can apply conching processes from 12 to 78 hours, due to the high levels of acetic acid and other compounds that can have a negative impact on the final flavour of the chocolate. This is a disadvantage in terms of production efficiency (costs and energy).</p>\n<p>The conching process is a specific step during chocolate manufacturing, which is very important for enhancing the quality of the finished product. However, long heat treatment and high shear -required for the removal of undesirable volatile compounds and moisture- present disadvantages for production efficiency and cost.</p>\n<p>With this information, the next time you eat chocolate, close your eyes, pay attention to texture as the chocolate melts in your mouth, take a slight breath of air to assess flavour, and remember that behind that complexity, the joint work of science and nature is the magic behind new sensory experiences.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'DIEGO CORTÉS', avatar: '', details: 'Research and Development Professional', description: 'Bilingual Chemical Engineer (English - Spanish), Master in Bromatology and Food Technology, with strong experience in Research, Development and Innovation in chocolate and other food companies, also in academic environments.

Traditionally, the cultivation of cocoa in Colombia was an activity in which farmers used to be very poor; they did not have technological resources or administrative management and did not have the capacity to project their businesses in the medium or long-term.</p>\n<p>We came up with a business development model that would stimulate small producers around cocoa. In 2010, Luker Chocolate opted to grow its own crops to help the company satisfy its own Cacao Fino de Aroma needs -without abandoning the relationships established with cocoa associations all over the country-, in order to promote demonstrative agroindustrial projects that would promote large-scale cocoa plantations to drive rural development. In the same year, the company found 550 hectares of land traditionally used for cattle farming in Necocli, Antioquia. It turned this land into its first agroindustrial plantation and the largest agro-productive plantation of varieties of Cacao Fino de Aroma in the country, designed as an agroforestry system (simultaneous and continuous integration of fruit trees and timber-yielding varieties with agricultural crops, which allow greater yields and avoid soil erosion and loss of biodiversity).</p>\n<p>Today, the plantation provides employment for over 180 people (it previously employed only 5) and over 600,000 new trees have been planted, leading to high economic, social and environmental impact among neighbouring communities. Here, The Chocolate Dream, our long-term vision to drive change in the cocoa producing regions where we work, was born.</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate was the first company that dared to start a cocoa crop business model in Colombia, specifically, in the cultivation of Cacao Fino de Aroma. In the first place, this required an important change of mentality. This meant a move from having farms to having companies, adopting technology, training human capital, implementing transparent and efficient administrative processes, and, in general, looking at the business on a much larger scale. All this is intended to guarantee results for Luker Chocolate, but also to ensure its vertical integration and the traceability and quality of our cocoa. Additionally, this model radiates examples of good production practices, technological tools and investment models in the area for the producing regions. Likewise, it produces parallel productive initiatives, improves the conditions of the surrounding areas and increases the quality of life of the people who inhabit them. Finally, it has shown the country that it is possible to have profitable large-scale cocoa projects.</p>\n<p>The first project was designed in Necoclí, a region that had been damaged by violence and very precarious health and nutrition conditions. It was this project that ended up giving life to The Chocolate Dream. One of the great problems that this country has had is that in the remote regions some infrastructure has been created, but no development has been generated. We have to offer an activity for people to stay in the region, to have something to live with. That is when bridges and roads make sense. In my opinion, the Luker Chocolate cocoa cultivation business model works because it is a motor of economic development. If you do not economically develop a region, the bridge and the community centre don’t work. If there is one factor that generates money and moves the economy, development in these regions becomes possible. That’s why The Chocolate Dream works in Necocli.</p>\n<p>Necocli was the first of several projects that the company intends to plant, followed by a double-sized plantation in Casanare department, in a crop previously used for the production of oil palm. The Casanare project has 1000 hectares of cocoa in an agroforestry system with palm, which today has generated 500 formal jobs.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the development of another anchor crop in the department of Huila is expected, as part of an initiative to promote the planting of cocoa in that department. The main objective of the anchor crop is to provide on-site support to farmers in the region as part of a large promotion program in which other inhabitants are invited to plant cocoa. The goal is to expand the cocoa crop in the region with 350 new hectares of cacao and 450 hectares of crop renovation in 6 municipalities, which would impact 375 families.</p>\n<p>For me, it is a source of pride to know that this company is not afraid to undertake major projects, rather it has been a pioneer and example throughout the country for this very reason.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'GUIDO SIERRA', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHh3XbrtXhmKQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=PD2w7KFQty_KkqUIHiUYgJNfA9GLs_S1MTMSqczVWWI', details: 'General Manager Luker Agricola', description: '17 years of professional experience in human talent management and generation of high performance teams, Financial Management, Process Optimization, Installation and commissioning of industrial facilities and Development of Supply Chains with successful results in increases in efficiency, productivity, reduction of costs and value generation through the satisfaction and loyalty of customers and suppliers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-sierra-1301a339/', 'Guido Sierra'] },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DECEMBER 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AUGUST 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULY 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/create-shared-value', name: 'Create shared value' }],\n    url: 'chocolate–spreading-the-love-worldwide',\n    title: 'CHOCOLATE – SPREADING THE LOVE WORLDWIDE',\n    cover: 'stand-banner.jpg',\n    date: 'OCTOBER 2019',\n    content: `<p>Taking a trip to Colombia and living the #LukerExperience has proved an eye-opening experience for Le Salon Du Chocolat owner Dawn Shrives. She’s returned from the visit with a new appreciation of chocolate production and full of ideas as to how her Chichester-based business can help support the work being done in the South American country.</p>\n<p>Set up in 2004, Le Salon Du Chocolat is a chocolate studio where visitors can try their hand at themed workshops and parties. Dawn also gives talks and demonstrations to local organisations and schools.</p>\n<p>But Dawn’s passion is the ‘quality’ of chocolate from its source of cacao beans to the finished product. She explained:</p>\n<p>Particularly over the last 20 years as the demand for cocoa beans has increased, forcing the price upwards, many big chocolate brands that we have grown up to love are now using less cocoa and bulking their products out with cheaper alternative vegetable fats and wheat flour. Thus the finished products are described as ‘bars’ or ‘chocolate flavoured’ as is it no longer contains enough cocoa to be able to call it ‘chocolate’.</p>\n<p>Artisan chocolatiers are going back to using chocolate that contains only the basic ingredients that are needed. The couverture (chocolate buttons), which I use in my workshops, are made in Belgium and are a blend of cacao beans generally from Africa which is the source of around 70% of all cacao beans harvested. However I also use couvertures made with cacao beans from other growing regions such as Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica and when made from a single origin rather than a blend, give the chocolate a unique taste specific to that region.</p>\n<p>Dawn was one of 20 chocolatiers who travelled to Luker Chocolate, Colombia, on a trip to see for herself how cacao is cultivated, harvested and made into chocolate while learning how Luker is supporting their cocoa farmers, families and local communities. Luker, a family business set up in 1906, is a Colombian cocoa supplier and chocolate maker that believes cocoa production can deliver positive societal change: “We believe that chocolate makes the world a better place.” Luker Chocolate purchases almost 40% of the total cacao produced in Colombia and all cacao beans meet their ‘Fino de Aroma’ standards – fine cacao making up only 7% of the world’s total cacao.</p>\n<p>“The whole trip was a real eye-opener,” Dawn said. “Luker is one of the biggest companies in Colombia. What is different about Luker compared to other cacao growers is that it makes the whole product from bean to bar in Colombia, meaning it uses Colombian sugar, milk and labour, exporting the finished product rather than just the cacao beans. So Colombian dairy farmers and sugar cane growers also benefit directly.”.</p>\n<p>Dawn’s chocolate journey started the moment they touched down in Bogota with breakfast at the Luker factory of traditional hot chocolate, brioche and cheese. This was followed by chocolate tasting.</p>\n<p>“Every single stage of how the beans are grown, harvested and processed into our chocolate makes a huge impact on the final taste”, Dawn explained. “One example was tasting chocolate that had been made with beans roasted at 130 degrees compared to those at 160 degrees. The difference in degrees had made the chocolate almost inedible!”.</p>\n<p>The group were flown to Granja Luker – a training and research centre where the farmers are educated, and fino de aroma beans are cultivated and grown into saplings which are sold to farmers for their own plantations. Since its founding in 1962, Granja Luker has educated 700 farmers a year to grow and cultivate Fino de Aroma cocoa beans.</p>\n<p>One highlight for Dawn was a visit to Necocli, which is very near the gateway to Panama. A few years ago, Luker planted 550 hectares there with 600,000 new cacao trees, creating 180 new jobs in an area known for armed conflict. The villagers, including their three schools within this area have been hugely supported by Luker.</p>\n<p>Dawn said: “We visited two of the schools within the cacao plantation and were asked to take the children educational gifts and tell them something about our lives. I took postcards of Chichester and the Witterings to show the children where I live and so they can use them to write back to me and I will pass those to local schoolchildren. I would love to be able to make a connection with schools in West Sussex and Colombia.</p>\n<p>The village within the cacao plantation known as ‘Caribia’, has been transformed thanks to The Chocolate Dream project. The Chocolate Dream was born out of Luker Chocolate’s long-term vision to lead social and economic development in the cocoa-producing regions. Luker began to wonder about their responsibility as a company. What more could they bring to the countryside, to the people, the children, and neighbours? Volunteers working under The Chocolate Dream project have helped to paint houses, encouraged villagers to start up micro businesses with their traditional cane weaving and jewellery making. On the coastal strip of Necocli, they aim to build the town into a thriving holiday destination. The Chocolate Dream Project has helped at least 11 new start-up businesses including a young lad to set up a micro museum, after he discovered ancient artefacts dating back to the Spanish settlement in 1509 buried in his garden.”</p>\n<p>The trip has transformed Dawn’s outlook.:</p>\n<p>She said: “I feel so privileged to have been given this opportunity to visit Colombia and learn the history and story behind the lives of people who are growing great chocolate. .</p>\n<p>Having used their chocolate for over a decade, and now seen the work that Luker and their Chocolate Dream project are doing, I am so excited to help them share this story Maria de Restrepo was a member of Luker Chocolate’s founding family. Every Saturday, in Manizales, she would stand at her window to give out chocolate to the homeless for the sole reason of consoling them and making sure they had food in their stomachs. At that time, there had been no research on the ‘happiness of eating chocolate’, but what she did and the chocolate she gave out must have comforted many. I guess that by using Luker chocolate today, I am doing the same – not only supporting the families at the source of this journey, but by bringing the happiness of sharing their fine chocolate with my customers. The Swiss named cacao ‘Theobroma’ in the 18th century, meaning ‘food of the gods’. I like to believe I am a modern day version of a ‘chocolate goddess’ and it is my duty to bring the best chocolate to everyone’s door. And if it can be done in a way that I know I am helping and supporting the families that supply it, then that’s even better.”</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'JOSÉ MALDONADO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGWmXeWsufD9Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=sPc6xh78N7oYmS61XLxym_XcKLYzzBJ9PSp5kyFCPQk', details: 'SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY ANALYST', description: 'Sustainable Supply Analyst for Luker Chocolate, focused on agricultural development and sustainability projects of the company\\'s value chain.Project leader for organizations of cocoa producers and small- scale farmers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-miguel-maldonado-v%C3%A9lez-79a818114/', 'Jose Maldonado'] },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DECEMBER 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AUGUST 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULY 2019', url: '/blog/take-stand/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/create-shared-value', name: 'Create shared value' }],\n    url: 'cocoa-forests-and-peace',\n    title: 'COCOA, FORESTS, AND PEACE',\n    cover: 'banner-cacaos-w.jpg',\n    date: 'OCTOBER 2019',\n    content: `<p>At Luker Chocolate, every day we set out and strive to grow based on our higher purpose: to make the world a better place, by helping other companies create purpose-driven products, using our chocolate as a tool for change. This future and change that we dream of begins in the cocoa-producing regions of Colombia, from where we grow the best Cacao Fino de Aroma. But we didn’t want to stop there. That’s why, a few years ago, we decided to put all our strength into the Colombian countryside to offer real solutions. That’s where “The Chocolate Dream” was born.</p>\n<p>The challenge is enormous. In Colombia, cocoa is produced in 27 of the 32 departments, resulting in great geographical dispersion in terms of production and a number of barriers for producers and their families. In addition, Colombia’s main cocoa-growing regions have historically been zones of armed conflict, illegal mining, drug trafficking, etc.; and unfortunately, many still are today. Despite obstacles appearing time and again along the way, our dream is even greater. We know that we cannot do it alone and that the key to achieving our goal is teamwork. It is only in through teamwork that we will be able to make “The Chocolate Dream” stop being just a dream.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Necoclí\">\n<p>A clear reflection of the union and joint efforts is the Cocoa, Forests and Peace initiative, a public-private project aimed at promoting zero-deforestation production models that favour the protection and restoration of forests in the cocoa supply chain, but also contribute to building peace in our country.</p>\n<p>The initiative was born in March 2017 when the Declaration of Intent for the Global Cocoa and Forests Initiative was launched, led by the World Cocoa Foundation, The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), non-profit organisations, and more than 35 private sector companies, who signed the macro agreements for joint action in Ghana and Ivory Coast, mainly. In July 2018, Colombia became the first country in Latin America and the third in the world to adhere to the initiative and sign its own agreement.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-forest.dfaf6862.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa forest\">\n<p>Luker Chocolate was the first private sector company to believe in and sign the Cocoa, Forests, and Peace initiative in Colombia. We participated in the planning and structuring of the action plan, which was officially launched last September in Bogotá. We decided to be part of this project because we know that the basis of everything we do lies in the cocoa-producing regions, because that is our source of inspiration and the opportunity we have to transform communities.</p>\n<p>So, this initiative sets in motion its 10-year action plan, led by the ministries of Environment and Sustainable Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, the cocoa industry represented by Luker Chocolate and the National Federation of Cocoa Growers (Fedecacao), the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), and the World Resources Institute (WRI), with the support of the World Cocoa Foundation.</p>\n<p>It will be 10 years of working, shoulder to shoulder, in which we seek to achieve the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>45 milestones in total (25 in the short term, 12 in the medium term, and 8 in the long term).</li>\n<li>76 activities over 2 years.</li>\n<li>51 management indicators for 2-year activities.</li>\n<li>More than 73 indicators that will measure the information system.</li>\n<li>5 major results by 2030:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Zero deforestation cocoa production models.</li>\n<li>Financial instruments that consolidate cocoa models with zero</li>\n<li>orestation.</li>\n<li>Monitoring, verification, and traceability systems.</li>\n<li>Strengthening of cocoa institutions for forests and peace.</li>\n<li>Communication and transparency strategies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following new signatories will also join forces for the implementation phase: the Swiss Embassy (SECO), Climate Focus, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Organización Alisos, Rainforest Alliance, Lök Foods, Mariana Cocoa Export, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), WWF and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).</p>\n<p>Cocoa, Forests, and Peace is a very important milestone for cocoa farming in Colombia and everything behind it. It will be the first major pact for the sustainable development of cocoa production in the country that will be made by the three sectors of the economy.

The products will be exhibited at the Idea SuperMarket, a part of the fair that shows what supermarkets, hypermarkets and retailers of all kinds are doing with their brands. The products that will be shown here are selected based on their level of innovation determined by a jury. A couple of weeks after we submitted our ideas, we received the great news of having had two of our innovations selected: Beau Cao and Protein Pud.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/beau-cau.cbf77ddd.jpg\" alt=\"Beau Cao\">\n<p>Today we are going to tell you what Beau Cao is all about. Beau Cao is a product developed from VitalCao, a line of Luker Chocolate’s functional ingredients offering cocoa powders with the best benefits derived from cocoa. After 11 years of intense research and thanks to all the possibilities afforded by being present throughout our chocolate value chain, from the cocoa bean to the final product, we developed a unique production method, patent pending, where we control post-harvest practices (fermentation and drying) and the industrial process to obtain a large amount of antioxidants from cocoa. All this has resulted in a portfolio of natural products that provide health benefits in the modern era.</p>\n<p>One of VitalCao’s strongest innovations is its ability to protect the body’s cells from UV rays. The antioxidant properties of VitalCao prevent the formation of free radicals triggered by exposure to ultraviolet rays. Based on the benefits of VitalCao and understanding that beauty is a process that must be cultivated from the inside out, at Luker Chocolate we decided to launch Beau Cao, a product that is both indulgent and cares for your skin by reconstituting it from within.</p>\n<p>Beau Cao’s formula helps protect cells up to 60% more than regular chocolate, which means your body is protected from the sun’s rays from within. It also helps to reduce inflammation that may occur in skin tissues up to 26% more than regular chocolate.</p>\n<p>At Luker Chocolate, we conducted a medical study with Ikemia IUCT (a Spanish high-tech business group aimed at developing and exploiting new products) to scientifically prove the benefits of daily consumption of Beau Cao. For a year, 10 healthy subjects, with an average age of 35.4 years and skin type II (according to the FitzPatrick scale), consumed 4 to 6 grams of VitalCao daily. We then exposed 1×1 cm areas of their untanned skin on the inner side of the forearm to increasing doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR, model 601 multiport solar simulator, sunlight, Glenside, PA). The results showed that there was a significant increase in the skin’s photoprotective effect, which is directly related to the product’s high antioxidant activity.</p>\n<p>Clinical studies made by our research and development department, prove that the 45% cocoa Beau Cao has 75% more flavanols (components found in some foods that help the body protect itself from damage caused by oxidising agents such as ultraviolet rays, environmental pollution, chemicals in food, etc.) than a regular milk chocolate with the same cocoa content. The 58% and 70% cocoa content versions (the 70% one is the one we will present at PLMA) contain 57% and 47% more flavanols respectively than a regular chocolate.</p>\n<p>You will find more information about our product in this infographic:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/ficha-beau-cao.4216f6f5.jpg\" alt=\"Beau Cao Infographic\">\n<p>We are proud to launch our first innovation in the beauty sector and to participate in PLMA’s Supermarket Idea.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in Beau Cao, join us; this innovation could be yours and part of your private label portfolio. If you want to learn more about the product, come to the Luker Chocolate Market to be held in the North Hall, stand F3011, from November 17 to 19 at the Rosemont Convention Centre in Chicago.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you!</p>\n<small>*These studies were carried out by internal investigations of Casa Luker S.A.

We will also present one of our latest product innovations: Beau Cao, a chocolate that nurtures beauty from the inside. We will exhibit the product at the New Product Expo, a platform where only some of the companies taking part in the fair will be able to exhibit their latest innovations.</p>\n<p>Today, the protagonist of this blog is the Protein Pud, the second innovative product that we will exhibit on the platform. A formulation that we have developed for our clients who would like to have it in their private label portfolio. Here we are going to tell you how the creative process of this product was.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/protein-pud.e083a995.jpg\" alt=\"Protein pud\">\n<p>Today, people have less time to stay home and to prepare homemade meals. They have other priorities such as a social life and personal care. This is why snacks have become the perfect solution to lengthen the time between one meal and another, while also being satisfying.</p>\n<p>Based on the behavior of these consumers, we decided to develop the Protein Pud: an instant soy protein pudding sweetened with stevia that doesn’t need refrigeration. A perfect, quick to prepare, healthy, delicious, and satisfying snack. With its innovative formulation all you have to do is add a little cold water to obtain your desired texture. It is an herbal product, so it is suitable for vegans. And to make the Protein Pud experience even more memorable, you can add different toppings such as nuts, dried or fresh fruit, cocoa nibs, etc.</p>\n<p>Our Research and Development team spent more than 6 months searching for the right formulation to create the balance between texture and taste. First, we looked for the raw materials that would give us the creamy, soft sensation we wanted. Then, there was the challenge of maintaining the exquisite flavour and texture of chocolate made with our characteristic Cacao Fino de Aroma. However, the most important challenge was to find a way for all of these properties to be maintained in a cold-water preparation without the pudding cracking or becoming granular.</p>\n<p>Aside from being indulgent and innovative, the Protein Pud is a good source of protein, one of the most important nutrients in the human body, vital for muscle formation and which plays a fundamental role in the proper functioning of the immune system. In addition, it provides calcium, a complex of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, and minerals such as iron, zinc and copper.</p>\n<p>With the formula perfected, the ultimate question was how to show the world and our customers this innovation. To this end, we developed two product presentations. One is the ‘on the go’, individual presentation, designed for people who want to have a snack anytime, anywhere. The other, the ‘home presentation’, is ideal for preparing something delicious and healthy while at home away from the routine.</p>\n<p>You will find more information about our product in this infographic:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/ficha-protein-pud.b6ddb06e.jpg\" alt=\"Protein pud infographic\">\n<p>At Luker Chocolate, we are very proud to present our latest innovations and of the fact that both Beau Cao and Protein Pud are present in the PLMA Supermarket Idea.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in Protein Pud, feel free to join us; this innovation could be yours and be part of your private label portfolio.

So they had to continue with the tradition, turn it into the territory’s heritage, the celebration of the cocoa harvest, and its effects on the lives of the locals.</p>\n<p>And so it was that in 2018, we decided to do it again and now we are planning it together with Luker, the locals, the leaders, the Luker Foundation, as a single entity jointly defining what will be the most awaited festival of the year.</p>\n<p>This planning has involved great revolutions based on events that seemed irrelevant at first such as the definition of the agenda of activities. Together we began to meet to define timetables, people, allied budgets and activities.</p>\n<p>During this process of consensus and dissertations we discovered the importance of cultural, social, empathic and respectful dialogue involving different beliefs.</p>\n<p>The community’s first proposal included topics such as cock fights, beauty pageants, motorcycle tours, cultural presentations, gastronomic samples, dances, songs and thousands of other things that identified them. Luker presented photography contests, craft workshops, chocolate tastings and other things that represented us.</p>\n<p>In both proposals, there were enormous coincidences that made us feel like we had a single dream, a single purpose. But at the same time, as is natural when cultures meet, there were differences in some themes. And as we have always done, we decided to start conversing to find common ground.</p>\n<p>We had two themes that distanced us, cockfighting and the beauty pageant, both so traditional in Colombian culture. So we began to talk about these issues.</p>\n<p>From the company we respectfully proposed to omit the cockfights generating environmental and animal awareness. We also proposed that instead of celebrating women’s beauty, we should acknowledge their talent and their role in the more than 5 ethnic groups that live in the same territory.</p>\n<p>Our respectful stance on deep-rooted culture was that over time we would modify beliefs and behaviours and that the Cocoa Festival could reflect a joint way of looking at life, where people, animals, nature, and culture deserved the greatest respect.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/foto-tarima.0cef3648.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Festival\">\n<h3>We had a big, beautiful surprise.</h3>\n<p>Far from being discarded and generating discord, our proposals were immediately understood. We also saw how these positions were already incorporated in the community on an individual level, and that, in their own personal reflection, they all had had these concerns, but this had not reached the collective. The Cocoa Festival was becoming a vehicle that would help to put certain topics on the table.</p>\n<p>In a 3-hour long conversation, more than one and a half hours of planning were devoted to reflect on the beauty pageant; topics were touched on, led by the community, around the great talent of their women, the change in understanding the role of women, their importance in the culture and the differences between one ethnic group and another in that understanding. There was a reflection on what it means to put a young woman on a catwalk in a territory that had been sexist for years, the risk it represents and the message it sends to children.</p>\n<p>It was incredible to see and hear in the voices of those who are sometimes considered uneducated or behind in world trends, as they wish to contribute to gender equality, women’s empowerment, human rights education, and how they can use the festival to implement a ritual for the creation of values, to reinterpret beliefs and to celebrate the abundance and opportunities that a product, cocoa, has brought into their lives.</p>\n<p>The same thing happened with the cockfight, the consensus around this issue was very fast and we all decided to highlight values of care for the environment that this practice does not reflect.</p>\n<p>We left this meeting not only with a new agenda, with competitions for talented women and with environmental tours, but also with the firm conviction that these actions that sometimes do not seem to have as much impact as a festival, in the end are nothing more than the manifestation of the reinterpretation of the culture of a community and its encounter with other beliefs and communities.</p>\n<p>We witnessed a change that is not easy to witness in a country of traditions. The 2018 Cocoa Festival was a tribute to farmers, women, animals and nature.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/abrazo.55a56497.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Festival\">\n<p>In three days we will be living the third edition of the festival, everybody is welcome!</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.

Sin abandonar las relaciones establecidas con las asociaciones de cacao en todo el país, la compañía se propuso promover proyectos agroindustriales demostrativos que impulsarían las plantaciones de cacao a gran escala para impulsar el desarrollo rural. En el mismo año, la compañía encontró 550 hectáreas de tierra tradicionalmente utilizadas para la ganadería en Necoclí, Antioquia. Convirtió esta tierra en su primera plantación agroindustrial y la mayor plantación agroproductiva de variedades de Cacao Fino de Aroma, diseñada como un sistema agroforestal (integración simultánea y continua de árboles frutales y variedades que producen madera con cultivos agrícolas, lo que permite una mayor rendimientos y evitar la erosión del suelo y la pérdida de biodiversidad). Este proyecto nos ha permitido integrar toda la cadena de valor del cacao, desde la semilla hasta el producto final, creando un mayor bienestar social y ambiental en los territorios en los que trabajamos. Gracias a esto, podemos controlar todos los procesos de cacao, especialmente después de la cosecha.

Cada grano de cacao comprado se analiza en términos de su nivel de fermentación, humedad e impurezas. Luego, los granos se llevan al depósito de cacao en Bogotá, donde se repite el proceso. El licor de cacao se produce en el laboratorio de cacao, que luego utilizamos para validar el perfil sensorial de cada lote de cacao comprado y ratificar que realmente coincida con el origen del cual se compró. Durante el proceso de fabricación del chocolate, nuestro panel de calidad lleva a cabo un tercer análisis de calidad. Se realizan dos sesiones de panel de calidad sensorial al día, donde 15 panelistas altamente calificados analizan cada lote de chocolate que se fabrica.

Cada cosa nueva que descubrió la atrajo más profundamente en el mundo del chocolate y la presentó a los amantes del chocolate, a los fabricantes de chocolate, a los chocolateros y a los expertos de todo el mundo, incluidos nosotros.</p>\n  <p>Para ella, es muy importante trabajar con productos que involucran a comunidades que trabajan codo con codo, dándoles a ella y a otros profesionales del chocolate que cuenten nuevas historias a través de una experiencia positiva, que es lo que intentamos lograr todos los días en Luker Chocolate.</p>\n  <div class=\"blog-article-content--img\" ><img src=\"/static/media/york-blog.6edf6a0f.jpg\" alt=\"York Cocoa House\" /><span></span></div>`,\n},\n{\n  breads: [{ href: '/nuestros-clientes', name: 'Nuestros clientes' }],\n  url: 'royce',\n  title: 'ROYCE\\'',\n  cover: 'royce.jpg',\n  banner: 'royce-cover.jpg',\n  flag: 'jp',\n  content: `<p>ROYCE 'fue fundada en Sapporo, Japón, en 1983.

Miles de agricultores que hoy trabajan con nosotros, pasan gran parte de sus vidas bajo la sombra de un árbol.</p>\n<p>En nuestra Granja Luker, cientos de personas de todas partes del mundo han disfrutado de un desayuno con chocolate bajo la sombra de gigantescos árboles legendarios. Hemos sembrado árboles con nuestras propias manos, los hemos visto crecer. Nuestros abuelos y padres conversaban sobre el futuro, encontraban inspiración y tomaron decisiones transcendentales bajo los árboles. Las grandes conversaciones de nuestros antepasados no sucedieron en una oficina con traje y corbata; ocurrieron bajo los árboles de cacao, vistiendo poncho y sombrero.</p>\n<p>En nuestro bosque de cacao en Necocli, muchos hemos sido testigos de la sombra del mítico Campano; de las conversaciones que allí han acontecido. Bajo los árboles, hemos soñado, hemos reído y hemos llorado. Allí hemos encontrado algo de nuestra humanidad, nos hemos conectado con nuestra raíz, con nuestra cultura, con nuestra historia. Bajo los árboles hemos olvidado nuestros títulos y nuestra condición social, hemos sido iguales y sinceros, hemos entendido lo importante. Bajo los árboles hemos compartido nuestras diferencias, hemos innovado.

Una compañía con una visión que todavía hoy, después de cinco generaciones, se conserva; ya no solo en un hombre y su familia sino en el corazón de más de 1.000 colaboradores que componen la empresa.</p>\n<p>Después de más de un siglo, los sueños han crecido. Sabemos que podemos aportarle más al país desde el chocolate y estamos seguros de que, con la voluntad de muchos, esto que era una idea empieza a consolidarse y a convertirse en un modelo en el que la Colombia rural y sus habitantes son los protagonistas. Ya no solo soñamos con una fábrica de chocolate; nuestro propósito hoy es transformar vidas a través de él.</p>\n<p>La verdadera historia de la responsabilidad social y la sostenibilidad de Luker Chocolate es el recuento de un legado familiar que parte de un sueño, pero que se fue cimentando y extendiendo con todos sus miembros. En la búsqueda del propósito superior de Luker Chocolate, de su más profundo para qué, nos encontramos con las raíces de lo que hoy parece muy evidente, pero que, como siempre, tiene un origen en el corazón de uno o de varios. Allí conocimos muchas historias, el legado de una familia, sus valores y convicciones.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/the-birt-of-a-dream-1.38cc0657.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Empecemos por María de Restrepo, quien fue miembro de la familia fundadora de Luker Chocolate. Todos los sábados, en Manizales, salía a la ventana de su casa a repartir chocolate a los habitantes de calle. Sin ninguna pretensión más que dar algo de consuelo y alimento a algunos, llenaba cuadras enteras. Para ese entonces no se conocían las investigaciones acerca de la “felicidad que bridan el comer chocolate”, pero seguramente su servicio y este alimento lo lograron para muchos.</p>\n<p>A este recuento se suma don Jaime Restrepo, fundador de la Fundación Luker, de quien se cuenta que apoyaba a todo aquel que se le acercaba con una gran idea, le regalaba parte de su tiempo y financiaba algunos de estos proyectos. Con el tiempo esto dio origen a la fundación, la cual tuvo más adelante una gran benefactora, Inés Restrepo Mejía, quien desde siempre apoyó causas alrededor de la niñez, la educación y la mujer. Ella decidió dejarle todo su legado a la fundación, permitiendo hoy la implementación de programas que han tenido un gran impacto positivo en Manizales, en términos de educación y emprendimiento.</p>\n<p>Esta historia continúa gracias a las nuevas generaciones de la familia las cuales siguen construyendo país. Son muchos los que tienen detrás proyectos sociales, fundaciones, vocación de servicio y convicción de que entre muchos podemos construir un sueño. Todo lo anterior es la inspiración para la construcción de un modelo sostenible en el que queremos que Luker Chocolate perdure otros 100 años como negocio, para poder contribuir a todos aquellos que nos rodean, nuestros colaboradores, los agricultores, sus familias y nuestros clientes en todo el mundo.</p>\n<p>Como compañía nos empezamos a renovar internamente, manteniendo la tradición familiar de más de 100 años, pero sumando las nuevas tendencias globales encaminadas a la sostenibilidad. Queremos aportarle al país desde un modelo económico, ambiental y socialmente responsable. En este sentido, hemos sido siempre una empresa cercana a los agricultores colombianos en las distintas regiones cacaoteras. Los hemos acompañado a través de la Granja Luker por más de 60 años en su formación como productores, para que tengan una comprensión más técnica del campo, que les ayude a mejorar la productividad y su calidad de vida.</p>\n<p>Sin embargo, desde hace unos años nos empezamos a preguntar por nuevos caminos para el negocio, para el campo y para los pequeños agricultores. En esta búsqueda de nuevos modelos sostenibles para las regiones cacaoteras, que además coinciden en su mayoría con las regiones más afectadas por el conflicto armado, emprendimos un nuevo rumbo hacia la siembra de nuestros propios cultivos. Fue así como llegamos a Necoclí, en el Urabá antioqueño, para abrirle camino al cacao en una zona donde la violencia fue protagonista por tantos años. Llegamos contra todo pronóstico a sembrar 550 hectáreas de cacao en una tierra que había tenido por mucho tiempo una vocación ganadera; la trasformación fue un hito en la región. Se pasó de cinco a 220 empleos, de una finca con solo pasto, a la siembra de 600.000 nuevos árboles. Se empezó a hablar de estabilidad y futuro a partir de la formalidad en la contratación; las mujeres empezaron a protagonizar labores en el campo.</p>\n<p>Todavía hay muchos retos en las veredas vecinas a la finca. Los índices multidimensionales de pobreza siguen siendo muy altos y aún se ven las secuelas de la violencia en los ojos de los niños y niñas. Todo el equipo que estaba emprendiendo esta nueva etapa empezó a preguntarse por nuestra responsabilidad como compañía. ¿Qué más podíamos aportar al campo, a la gente, a los niños y niñas, a nuestros vecinos? Así nació El Sueño de Chocolate, la visión de largo plazo de Luker Chocolate para liderar desarrollo social y económico en las regiones productoras de cacao donde trabajamos. Poco a poco, el Sueño se fue convirtiendo en el ADN de la estrategia de sostenibilidad de la compañía; sabíamos que podíamos dar más y encontramos cómo. Hoy, Luker Chocolate tiene una estrategia en la que los componentes económicos, ambientales y sociales van tomando el mismo peso y en la que el modelo de negocio se alinea con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible.</p>\n<p>Capitalizamos todas las buenas prácticas de más de 110 años en un modelo de intervención integral en los territorios, ya no solo en Necoclí, sino también en Casanare, Huila, Tumaco y, a mediano plazo, las demás zonas cacaoteras del país. Sabemos que somos responsables del rumbo de Colombia y de nuestro planeta. Queremos que el campo colombiano logre ser protagonista, pero no por el sufrimiento que hubo a causa de la violencia, sino por su prosperidad, su dignidad, su potencial de desarrollo, sus saberes, su arte y su cultura.</p>\n<p>Hemos integrado completamente nuestra cadena de valor para lograrlo, humanizando en primer lugar sus eslabones. Ya no hablamos de materia prima sino de agricultores y comunidades; ya no hablamos de transformación del cacao sino de equipos con propósito; no hablamos solo de ingresos sino de clientes con proyectos de vida. Adicionalmente, nuestra cadena de valor está buscando no ser lineal sino circular, de modo que el cliente pueda devolverle algo al campo a través de proyectos creados por nosotros y financiados por ellos, para mejorar las condiciones de vida de las comunidades y los agricultores que día a día trabajan por llevarles el mejor chocolate a su país.</p>\n<p>El Sueño de Chocolate logra abrir nuevas conversaciones con todo aquel que tenga sobre su mesa un producto hecho con chocolate de Luker; un producto que no solo tiene la mejor calidad sino que carga consigo la historia de nuestro campo colombiano.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/the-birth-of-a-dream.68663234.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Sabemos que somos muchos los que tenemos que sumarnos para hacer de este sueño un movimiento que tenga la capacidad de recorrer el mundo. Por eso, El Sueño de Chocolate pronto abrirá sus puertas para que todos aquellos que quieran contribuir con su conocimiento, su experiencia y su tiempo, puedan encontrar en Luker Chocolate, el lugar para hacerlo.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.

Aquellos negocios que solucionen efectivamente una necesidad, logrando cobrar lo suficiente para cubrir sus costos y generar una utilidad, diremos que habrán creado valor económico.</p>\n<p>El problema de esto, como ocurre en su mayoría hoy, es que muchas empresas han caído en obsesionarse por luchar en segmentos de consumo típicamente iguales a sus competidores y peor aún, ofreciendo lo mismo. Han caído en intensificar la competencia, invirtiendo enormes sumas de dinero en publicidad, intentando sobresalir con mínimas innovaciones incrementales poco relevantes. Ganarle un punto de mercado al competidor, se ha convertido en una obsesión que consume grandes recursos, tiempo y mentes brillantes.</p>\n<p>Si bien decíamos que el propósito de un negocio tiene que ver con solucionar necesidades, ¿En que momento nos alejamos de tratar de solucionar las grandes, urgentes y complejas necesidades de nuestra sociedad? Acaso la contaminación, la salud, la nutrición, la vivienda, la pobreza, la falta de agua, la violencia, la educación, entre muchos otros, ¿No son necesidades? ¿Por qué las empresas toman distancia de las necesidades más complejas y relevantes de nuestra sociedad? ¿Por qué no estamos viendo las grandes necesidades como lo que deberían ser: oportunidades de negocio enormes?</p>\n<p>Tuve la oportunidad de estar a finales de 2018 con el profesor Michael Porter en su curso de Valor Compartido en Harvard Business School. El profesor Porter y su equipo nos invitan a reflexionar sobre cómo hemos crecido bajo una sabiduría convencional mediante la cual se cree que los problemas sociales son problema del gobierno y de las ONGs, mas no de las empresas. Y ese camino que hemos transitado durante décadas nos está llevando a destruir nuestro planeta. No hemos sido efectivos como sociedad en su conjunto en resolver los problemas más graves. No vamos por buen camino. No es el camino.</p>\n<p>Considero, firmemente, que, en la esencia del concepto del valor compartido, se encuentra una nueva noción de estrategia empresarial que reúne una poderosa y real disrupción a la hora de entender los negocios. Si bien es un concepto que se encuentra madurando en diferentes aspectos, serán únicamente los empresarios más valientes, aquellos que se atrevan a incorporarlo, quienes permitan refinar su entendimiento y afinar su medición. Crear valor compartido significa, solucionar un problema social a través de un modelo de negocio. Un negocio pensando como un negocio, que logra crear valor económico, como resultado de resolver un problema social. Y es justamente la capacidad de crear valor económico, la ganancia, la que permite escalar determinada solución; cosa que no pueden hacer en sentido estricto las ONGs ni los gobiernos.</p>\n<p>Adicional al concepto de valor compartido, existen muchas otras líneas de pensamiento que apuntan a un interés común. Entre ellos invito a estudiar las poderosas iniciativas lideradas por Sir Ronald Cohen desde el Impact Investment; la visión de B-Lab y su creciente e inspirador movimiento de B-Corps; las diferentes aproximaciones del capitalismo consciente y muchos otros grupos de trabajo y sus experiencias que iremos discutiendo en nuestro blog.  Independientemente de la preferencia y afinidad académica de cada quien, a lo que realmente quiero invitar a nuestros clientes, proveedores, aliados, emprendedores y empresarios, es a preguntarnos muy seriamente: ¿Cuál es el rol que queremos que nuestras empresas y nuestras marcas tengan en la urgente misión de cambiar el rumbo de nuestra sociedad? ¿Cómo podemos reinterpretar el rol de los negocios, para aportar de manera contundente soluciones sostenibles a problemas relevantes?</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/unique-flavour.b9eb31ba.jpg\" alt=\"Luker brand\">\n<p>En Luker Chocolate creemos firmemente que las empresas tienen tal vez la más poderosa capacidad de poder ofrecer soluciones reales y escalables a problemas apremiantes y urgentes. Creemos también que es importante compartir experiencias y aprendizajes. Vemos con optimismo y celebramos como un grupo cada vez más grande de empresas en el mundo se animan a recorrer el camino de entender los negocios como una herramienta de cambio, tanto empresas existentes, así como la poderosa ola de nuevos emprendedores sociales a los que debemos animar, ayudar y potenciar.</p>\n<p>En Luker Chocolate hemos tenido una sensibilidad histórica por diferentes problemáticas sociales a lo largo de estos 113 años, en esencia, gracias a un conjunto de valores heredados a través de cinco generaciones. En esa historia hemos recorrido diferentes aproximaciones, desde la filantropía, la responsabilidad social corporativa, así como el trabajo social desde Fundación Luker en temas de educación y emprendimiento. Desde hace algunos años, hemos ido evolucionando ese interés para tratar de incorporar la idea del valor compartido en el corazón de la estrategia del negocio. Tengo para decir que no es un camino fácil, ni rápido. No es un camino nítido, ni sencillo, más aún cuando se trata de un negocio que ya está andando, lo que implica repensar múltiples actividades sobre la marcha. Uno de los retos más complejos sobre los que hoy estamos profundizando tiene que ver justamente con la medición del impacto social y su respectiva correlación con la creación de valor económico para la empresa. Sin embargo, a pesar de lo retador y lo exigente, y a pesar de que muchas cosas están aún en construcción, desde mi experiencia profesional ha sido un camino maravilloso. Un camino que nos ha permitido abrir las fronteras de la innovación y visualizar nuevas formas en que nuestra operación y modelo de negocio puede impactar positivamente a la sociedad. Un camino gratificante desde lo humano.</p>\n<p>En este camino hemos podido detenernos a reflexionar y profundizar sobre los problemas más complejos de nuestra industria, a saber, territorios cacaoteros en Colombia marcados por violencia histórica, drogas, ilegalidad, pobreza, falta de oportunidades, ausencia de infraestructura y educación, entre muchos otros. Ver esos problemas desde la óptica del valor compartido nos ha llevado a innovar. Y es eso, la innovación, la herramienta indispensable para incorporar el valor compartido dentro de una estrategia. La innovación es una prioridad absoluta a la hora de pretender dar solución a problemas sociales complejos y al mismo tiempo, crear valor económico. Dado que son esas condiciones adversas un terrero desconocido, es la innovación, fundada en la experimentación, la que permite tratar cosas diferentes. Y es, únicamente hasta que se comienzan a ver los resultados sociales tangibles, el momento en que todo cobra sentido.</p>\n<p>En Luker Chocolate proveemos chocolate como ingrediente para la industria y fabricamos productos terminados para otras marcas alrededor del mundo. Nuestros clientes abarcan desde pequeños chocolateros artesanales hasta grandes industrias, desde emprendedores que están lanzando nuevas marcas hasta grandes retailers bien consolidados. Los rasgos comunes entre ellos son claros: Un marcado interés y compromiso por apoyar el impacto social y ambiental; una mentalidad emprendedora que le apuesta a la innovación y una clara prioridad por un sabor superior. Como empresa B4B (Business for business), en Luker Chocolate decimos que nuestra misión es ayudar a otras empresas a crear productos de chocolate con propósito. Nuestros clientes son en su mayoría protagonistas activos de El Sueño de Chocolate, nuestra visión de largo plazo para transformar las regiones cacaoteras donde operamos. Existen varias formas en que visualizamos nuestra alineación con el propósito de nuestros clientes y en donde les ayudamos a potenciar sus marcas y modelos de negocio:</p>\n<h3>CONEXIÓN CON EL ORIGEN A TRAVÉS DE PROYECTOS DE IMPACTO</h3>\n<p>Co-creamos con nuestros clientes proyectos de impacto social en los diferentes territorios cacaoteros y alrededor de las comunidades de nuestros bosques de cacao propios. Ejecutamos inversiones conjuntas en temas de educación, emprendimiento, arte y cultura y medioambiente. Le apostamos a mejorar la diversificación económica rural en diferentes verticales como el turismo y otras iniciativas de mercado con miras a construir prosperidad y fortalecer la competitividad de las regiones. En esta aproximación nuestros clientes se vinculan apostándole también a lo desconocido, a proyectos experimentales innovadores que nos permitan construir nuevo conocimiento. En este esfuerzo ayudamos a nuestros clientes a diseñar estrategias únicas para conectar sus proyectos con su marca para que sus consumidores lo conozcan y lo vivan, lo prefieran y lo paguen.</p>\n<h3>LOS COCOAHBS, NUESTRO CENTRO DE INNOVACIÓN SOCIAL Y DE EMPRENDIMIENTO</h3>\n<p>Este espacio esta dedicado a recibir personas que voluntariamente llegan de todas partes del mundo para entregar su tiempo y conocimiento para apoyar tanto a los emprendedores rurales de las comunidades locales, así como a generar soluciones a problemas reales de la zona. La intención de este espacio es poder abrir las puertas a diferentes disciplinas para potenciar nuestra mirada de la innovación social. Nuestros clientes, sus consumidores, nuestros proveedores y aliados son bienvenidos a vivir esta experiencia única.</p>\n<h3>IMPACTO DESDE EL DESARROLLO DE NUEVOS PRODUCTOS</h3>\n<p>Nuestros nuevos desarrollos de producto, adicional a ser únicos en su sabor por ser hechos a partir de cacao 100% Fino y de Aroma, podemos conceptualizarlos y diseñarlos con una misión social en mente: Desde chocolates sin azúcar potenciados con fibra y proteínas para apoyar en dietas saludables, hasta formulaciones mucho mas sofisticadas con ingredientes funcionales que nos permiten buscar mejoras en nutrición de manera específica dada la poderosa capacidad antioxidante del cacao. Todo el tiempo revisamos múltiples ingredientes que puedan acompañar nuestros chocolates para potenciarlos en su capacidad de mejorar la salud, pero manteniendo su promesa de indulgencia. Los chocolates oscuros y de origen son nuestra fortaleza. Chocolates veganos y otros conceptos para abordar la salud hacen parte permanente de nuestra exploración e insumos para crear productos que pretenden mejorar a las personas desde lo que consumen. Los empaques sostenibles y responsables con el medio ambiente hacen parte central de este tipo de productos.</p>\n<p>Estas son solo 3 de las muchas otras iniciativas en donde podemos hacer que una marca se nutra con propósito, que lo descubra, que lo visualice y que se anime a incorporarlo en el centro de su apuesta de nuestra mano. Soñamos con ayudar a crear una industria inspiradora de la mano de nuestros clientes, donde usemos el chocolate como una herramienta de cambio.</p>\n<p>¿Quieres usar nuestros deliciosos chocolates Finos y de Aroma?

Tampoco una declaratoria de amor. Es la búsqueda más trascendente que he hecho en los últimos dos años en la solución al reto profesional más bestial al que me he enfrentado. Te contaré…</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate es una compañía que tiene más de 113 años de historia. Sin embargo, hace tan solo 10 años decidimos internacionalizarnos para llevar nuestro chocolate por el mundo. Con las ilusiones puestas en esta meta, nos dimos cuenta de que teníamos que afrontar nuevos retos. Vender chocolate a la industria y fabricar productos finales para otras compañías es un negocio que nada tiene que ver con lo que hemos hecho durante 100 años en Colombia; el reto de atender empresas y no consumidores finales,  y pasar de vender en más de 42 países y no en 1 solo país, es diferente.</p>\n<p>Por eso, cuando asumí la dirección de manufactura y posteriormente la vicepresidencia de cadena de abastecimiento en Luker Chocolate, con mi equipo teníamos la misión de elevar drásticamente el nivel de cumplimiento de la oferta de producción, garantizar la promesa de servicio a nuestros clientes, estabilizar los costos de producción y diseñar el plan de expansión de la planta de producción y los almacenes de logística, teniendo en cuenta el nuevo mercado internacional al que nos estábamos enfrentando.</p>\n<p>Pero, ¿cómo lograrlo? “Aumenta las eficiencias de las operaciones industriales y logísticas, regula inventarios y cumple con el nivel de servicio prometido a tus clientes”: voilà eres un COO (Chief Operations Officer) 10/10. Con seguridad te acompañará un buen desempeño de los costos, un sano capital de trabajo y, por supuesto, clientes felices. Otra vez aplausos, eres el Messi de la gestión de operaciones.</p>\n<p>¿Y qué pasa si un día esta fórmula falla?, ¿Qué pasa cuando los métodos tradicionales no responden?, ¿Qué sucede cuando tu cadena de abastecimiento no reacciona a los estímulos clásicos de la ingeniería en sus amplias disciplinas? Te doy la bienvenida a mi mundo.</p>\n<p>Durante 11 años he estado inmerso en operaciones industriales: muchas horas de sudor, otras tantas de lágrimas, pocas de sueño. Un título en ingeniería, dos maestrías, varios diplomados. ¿Y todo para qué?, para entender que al final somos tan infinitamente vulnerables que de todas formas una máquina va a tener problemas técnicos, la planta de producción se va a parar y por más modelos estadísticos de abastecimiento y distribución, tu cliente algún día se va a quedar sin tu producto. Somos humanos, y como tal no somos perfectos, por tanto, no podemos ser tan arrogantes como para pensar que lo que hacemos es a prueba de falla.</p>\n<p>Te voy a contar qué es lo que me ha mantenido de pie y siempre mirando hacia el frente: el espíritu de nuestra capacidad humana de transformación. Te lo juro, esa es la energía que me hace sentir pleno todos los días, la que me inspira a ver por los ojos de los demás, la que me llena de felicidad al ver cómo unas materias primas se convierten en un producto con historia que puede cambiarle el día a alguien y sacarle una sonrisa.</p>\n<h3>EL ESPÍRITU: UN NUEVO ELEMENTO EN LA ECUACIÓN</h3>\n<p>Fue precisamente en ese espíritu que empecé a ver una luz al final del túnel. Fue claro que la manera de innovar en un nuevo modelo para la cadena de abastecimiento de Luker Chocolate, poco o nada tenía que ver con números, modelos estadísticos y metodologías de mejora continua. Se trataba de innovar en la productividad desde un punto de vista humano y no técnico. Fue un golpe contra una muralla acorazada sin ninguna armadura puesta, era la chispa que estaba buscando.</p>\n<p>Así que manos a la obra, nos volcamos a la tarea de diseñar la estrategia de operación de toda la cadena de abastecimiento de Luker Chocolate, necesitaba ser rápida, efectiva, pero, sobre todo, genuina. Tenía que ser ambiciosa, no podíamos soñar pequeño, era necesario apuntarle a la luna. ¿Qué se esperaría de una propuesta estratégica de todo un equipo de ingenieros?, ¿Cuál fue el resultado?: Elevar el espíritu de nuestra gente. Pero así fue, nos pusimos una tarea titánica, todas las personas debían estar conectadas en cuerpo y alma con nuestro propósito en las plantas de producción, en los centros de distribución y en las oficinas administrativas.</p>\n<p>Renunciamos a poner en primera línea los costos de producción y los niveles de servicio hacia nuestros clientes; primero debíamos servirnos a nosotros mismos.</p>\n<h3>ALGO HABÍA QUE CUAJAR</h3>\n<p>La primera acción era clara, debíamos generar una identidad. Para ello nos volcamos inicialmente en la manufactura y comunicamos tres reglas de juego hasta agotarnos: liderazgo participativo, comunicación de doble vía e imprimir huella.</p>\n<p>Liderazgo participativo significaba repartir las cargas, era la forma de pedir ayuda a todo el equipo de trabajo y decirles que entre más personas remáramos en el barco, este iba a avanzar más rápido. Significaba empoderar, dejar hacer, acompañar y empujar. Empujar y pujar. Menos Messi’s, más equipos. Recordemos que somos vulnerables y siempre vamos a necesitar ayuda.</p>\n<p>Comunicación de doble vía no tenía una interpretación diferente a que, así como estaba validado que Directores y Jefes motivaran conversaciones con sus colaboradores, igualmente iba a estar validado que los colaboradores generaran estos espacios. Las jerarquías son mentales, pero el respeto y el diálogo son universales. Aquí el foco fue entrenarnos en la capacidad de conversar. De esto quedó una anécdota bastante jocosa, mi oficina fue apodada El Consultorio, pues era recurrente que de 1:00 p.m. a 2:00 p.m. se suscitaran conversaciones con colaboradores, personas que solo querían soñar y querían hacer mejor las cosas, pero necesitaban alas.</p>\n<p>Imprimir huella era lo que los trabajadores de la planta estaban logrando con su trabajo, solo que no lo sabían. Detrás de su esfuerzo existía un propósito superior, que nació con El Sueño de Chocolate y que finalmente maduró en nuestro chocolate transformándose en una herramienta de cambio.</p>\n<p>Tuvimos conversaciones de valor con nuestra gente, fuimos sensibles, empáticos y abrimos nuestras puertas, pues necesitábamos obsesionarnos con sentir una buena energía en la planta de producción, me obsesioné con llegar al día donde las personas nos miraran a los ojos cuando les habláramos. Escuchamos al mercado y aplicamos técnicas de conocimiento del consumidor, pero esta vez el mercado era nuestra planta y el consumidor cada uno de nuestros soldados de overol blanco que la dan toda para efectivamente hacer que nuestro chocolate sea una herramienta de cambio.</p>\n<h3>CAMBIO DE ESTRUCTURAS ORGANIZACIONALES, REDISEÑO DE OPERACIONES Y RIGUROSIDAD TÉCNICA</h3>\n<p>Las reglas de juego que te conté anteriormente no eran suficientes para solucionar el reto. Cuando se toca a la gente, es necesario repensar los métodos y la tecnologíapara que todo camine de la manera más armónica y balanceada posible, pues una gestión basada solo en lo técnico y en habilidades blandas es un alimento sin sal.</p>\n<p>En este punto fue necesario alistar todo el arsenal técnico de gerencia de operaciones para poner sobre la mesa cambios en los métodos y la tecnología.</p>\n<p>En los métodos, entre otras cosas, se lanzó un plan agresivo de aumento de eficiencias, un plan que tenía tres características: era práctico, fácil de entender y muy, muy técnico. Por otro lado, y quizá lo más relevante, fue el cambio de toda la estructura organizacional de administración de la planta de producción. Si queríamos un liderazgo participativo, comunicación de doble vía y que nuestra gente pudiera imprimir huella, la estructura de administración debía estar preparada para gobernar estos comportamientos.</p>\n<p>En términos tecnológicos, se formuló el Plan Maestro de Operaciones Industriales y Logísticas con el objetivo de duplicar la capacidad de producción de chocolates y preparar la ruta de desarrollo tecnológico de la compañía a 5 años. Se liberó un plan de 18 meses de ejecución, hoy nos faltan solo cuatro.</p>\n<h3>TANTO CAE AGUA AL CÁNTARO HASTA QUE SE ROMPE</h3>\n<p>Y sí. De tanto martillar, alguna puntilla tenía que entrar. Sorpresivamente, como una avalancha, todo el sistema de manufactura empezó a reaccionar, el nivel de servicio hacia nuestros clientes empezó a mejorar, los inventarios empezaron a regularizarse, los costos de producción se estabilizaron y empezamos a ver gente sonriente. Como cereza al postre, 7 meses después del lanzamiento de esta estrategia, la planta hizo su récord histórico de producción. Ni en el mejor de los sueños hubiera pensado que esto iba a ser así.</p>\n<p>A veces los mejores ejercicios prospectivos se hacen mirando al pasado, y en el pasado y presente de Luker Chocolate hay cercanía y familiaridad, son principios que están amarrados a nuestra historia. Solo necesitábamos abrazar estos dos elementos y empujarlos de una manera transparente y genuina, porque así deben ser tratados los principios y valores, jamás pueden ser vistos como peones en un juego de ajedrez.</p>\n<p>Si me preguntas dónde estuvo el elemento innovador en toda esta historia, te diría que fue en extraer a las personas del clásico análisis de recursos – los ingenieros industriales saben a qué me refiero -. Para nosotros, las personas no son ni serán vistas como recursos, serán siempre personas.</p>\n<p>¿Y cómo estamos hoy? Todavía falta trecho, hay demasiadas cosas susceptibles de mejora y lo más importante, aún hay conversaciones pendientes. Pero el camino sabe mejor cuando se celebran los pequeños triunfos.</p>\n<p>Nunca olvidemos que “todo arde si le aplicas la chispa adecuada”.</p>\n<p>Les presento a los que hicieron esta magia:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-5.e3d39bad.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Workers\">\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-worker.4139fa73.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa worker\">\n    `,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'CRISTIAN CHU', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHLclm7u9XKIg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=WjGN2LsdE9JD7XbCR7nKbDeK8KEejiW0DF3Qcx4HLZQ', details: 'Supply Chain Vicepresident', description: 'Electronic engineer with more than 10 years of experience in operations management and supply chain in the food and beverage sector.

En esta primera historia José Maldonado, Analista de Abastecimiento sostenible, nos cuenta su experiencia.</p>\n<p>Desde muy pequeño, el campo y yo hemos sido inseparables. Mi abuelo paterno es veterinario y ha sido productor de leche toda su vida; mientras que mi abuelo materno es caficultor, como lo fueron sus antepasados por varias generaciones. Siempre me he sentido orgulloso del campo colombiano y me he identificado como parte de este; tanto así, que más de una vez he dicho con la cabeza en alto “yo soy del campo”.</p>\n<p>Creí tener experiencia, pero después de pasar dos semanas acompañando a diferentes familias cacaocultoras del Huila, me di cuenta de que no podía estar más equivocado. Para ser del campo hace falta valentía y sacrificio, pero ante todo, hace falta tener un corazón gigante y estar profundamente enamorado de la tierra y sus tradiciones.</p>\n<p>En esta travesía conocí muchas personas, pero las historias que a continuación voy a contar, pertenecen a personas que me dejaron grandes lecciones de vida.</p>\n<p>El primero fue Pedro Nel Córdoba; él nos recibió en el aeropuerto de Neiva y nos dio la bienvenida. Este opita de acento cantado es el representante de Desarrollo Agrícola de Luker Chocolate para los departamentos de Huila, Tolima, Putumayo y Caquetá. No hay proveedor, finca o asociación donde no lo saluden con un fuerte abrazo y con la calidez de un hermano que vuelve a casa. Pedro conoce y entiende su tierra a la perfección, pues lleno de orgullo recuerda frecuentemente que él creció en el campo y que sus padres lo educaron a él y a 5 hermanos con los frutos de 1 hectárea de cacao. Él sabe bien lo que es luchar y trabajar por una finca que, por más pequeña que sea, es la esencia y el fruto de vida que mantiene a miles de familias campesinas en Colombia.</p>\n<p>El equipo de trabajo liderado por Pedro estaba listo para emprender nuestra travesía de 2 semanas por este hermoso departamento. Comenzamos en el municipio de Rivera; en este lugar visitamos tres familias pertenecientes a la Asociación de Productores de Cacao del Municipio de Rivera (). Tuve la fortuna de visitar la finca de Doña Carmen, una mujer de 82 años, pero con corazón y alma de 20. Ella es la matrona de su familia y se enorgullece de ser la cabeza de cuatro generaciones, pero aún más, de ver a sus hijos teniendo éxito gracias a la vida y educación que les pudo brindar con las 3 hectáreas de cacao que trabajó por tantos años con su difunto esposo.</p>\n<p>La casa de Doña Carmen queda justo al lado de su plantación de cacao. Es un hogar lleno de amor y detalles; se pueden ver diferentes imágenes católicas y fotografías con su familia. En la visita, recorrimos todo su cultivo y, planta por planta, esta mujer nos iba mostrando lo duro que trabaja por sus árboles de cacao y lo mucho que los conoce.</p>\n<p>El día siguiente fue revelador, pues se debía hacer la recolección y el desgranado de las mazorcas de cacao. Dos trabajadores eran los encargados de recolectarlas y además había un equipo de desgranado, del cual nosotros hacíamos parte. Lo que parecía una tarea sencilla, terminó siendo extenuante. En el lapso de una hora tuve que parar dos veces, ponerme de pie, estirar y esperar a que se me pasara el dolor de espalda. Mientras tanto, Doña Carmen, con sus 82 años, no se quejó ni una sola vez y solo se detuvo para almorzar. Ella simplemente se reía al vernos luchar para completar la tarea. Así aprendí que la fortaleza y el carácter de la gente del Huila son admirables.</p>\n<p>Nuestra siguiente parada fue el municipio vecino de Campoalegre, la capital arrocera del Huila. Una región con vocación agrícola y marcada por unos valles hermosos con diversos tipos de cultivos. En este lugar me marcó particularmente una finca en una zona montañosa, en donde comienza a predominar el café. Allí conocimos a Doña Concha, su hijo Gentil y a quien me daría una gran lección de vida: Samuel. Este hombre de tez morena, buen bigote, una alegría contagiosa y 35 años mal calculados, tiene su propio cultivo de maíz y cilantro en la finca y fue uno de nuestros guías.</p>\n<p>Samuel es ciego desde hace 8 años, pero nosotros no podíamos creerlo, y no fue porque dudáramos de su palabra, sino porque la forma en la que se ubica dentro de la finca es irreal. Nunca se pierde e incluso transita caminos muy peligrosos completamente solo. Lo más increíble de este hombre es su actitud. En un momento le preguntaron si había sido muy difícil recobrar su vida después de perder la vista y respondió, tranquilamente, “un poquito, no más”.</p>\n<p>Después de recorrer esta región del Huila, emprendimos un camino de unos 86 kilómetros hacia el sur del departamento. Recorrimos las orillas del Río Magdalena y la gigantesca Represa del Quimbo hasta nuestro último destino: Garzón. Este municipio es un importante foco cafetero de Colombia y una gran despensa agrícola para la región; además, se ha convertido en un punto muy importante de recolección de cacao para Luker Chocolate. Aquí fue donde tuve el encuentro más significativo y quizás el que más me inspiró a seguir trabajando por los cacaocultores de Colombia.</p>\n<p>En el penúltimo día de nuestra travesía, fuimos a la vereda Majo. En este lugar conocimos la finca de Don Ismael, un hombre de aproximadamente 80 años y oriundo de la región. Nuestro anfitrión principal fue “Chucho”, uno de sus hijos quien cuida de él y lo ayuda con las labores de la plantación de cacao. Tuvimos la oportunidad de ayudarlos en la jornada de trabajo recogiendo las mazorcas de cacao maduras durante toda la mañana. Fue hasta el final de la jornada, y después de disfrutar de un sancocho campesino, que llegó el personaje que tanto me marcó.</p>\n<p>Por la parte trasera de la casa entró un niño de unos 12 años, pelirrojo y lleno de pecas. Vestía un jean hasta las rodillas, una esqueleto blanco, una resortera cruzada en su pecho y unas botas de caucho. Traía un balde lleno de pescados pequeños que acababa de atrapar en un río cercarno. Parecía un Tom Sawyer colombiano, un niño aventurero de esos en peligro de extinción. Sin pensarlo, se acercó a nosotros a mostrarnos la pesca del día y nos comenzó a hablar de todo lo que hacía después de ir al colegio. Su nombre es Wilmer y es el nieto de Don Ismael. Me hizo un recorrido para mostrarme su cultivo de cebolla, unos patos que está criando y finalmente, lleno de orgullo, me mostró su propio árbol de cacao. En ese momento pensé: “el campo colombiano sí tiene un gran futuro y por niños como él es que debemos seguir trabajando”.</p>\n<p>Wilmer es un niño emprendedor y curioso. A muy temprana edad empezó a ayudar a su mamá, pues su padre los abandonó cuando él era solo un bebé. Pero esto nunca lo detuvo. Su forma de ver la vida, de apreciar el agro, sus ganas de salir adelante y el modo en el que ayuda a su familia, me marcaron de una forma indescriptible.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JOSÉ MALDONADO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGWmXeWsufD9Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=sPc6xh78N7oYmS61XLxym_XcKLYzzBJ9PSp5kyFCPQk', details: 'SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY ANALYST', description: 'Sustainable Supply Analyst for Luker Chocolate, focused on agricultural development and sustainability projects of the company\\'s value chain.Project leader for organizations of cocoa producers and small- scale farmers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-miguel-maldonado-v%C3%A9lez-79a818114/', 'Jose Maldonado']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/valor-compartido', name: 'Valor Compartido' }],\n    url: 'cacao-fino-de-aroma-herencia-cultural-e-historica-de-colombia',\n    title: 'CACAO FINO DE AROMA: HERENCIA CULTURAL E HISTÓRICA DE COLOMBIA',\n    cover: 'banner-cacaos.jpg',\n    date: 'JULIO 2019',\n    content: `<p>Hoy, después de haber desarrollado una historia de éxito alrededor del Cacao Fino de Aroma de Colombia en el mundo, y de abrir un mercado no solo para Luker Chocolate sino para todos los cacao-cultores del país, es importante recordar un poco el camino recorrido, analizar el presente y pensar en lo que vendrá.</p>\n<p>Una de nuestras ventajas más importantes, y que ha sido difícil de replicar por otras compañías en el mundo, es la capacidad desarrollada durante más de 100 años de jugar con los diferentes tipos de cacaos disponibles para mantener la consistencia en el sabor del chocolate, día tras día y año tras año, con el fin de que nuestros clientes puedan disfrutar del mejor chocolate colombiano. Fabricar un chocolate de mesa como Luker Tradicional —uno de nuestros productos del portafolio colombiano— que es hecho 100% de licor de cacao, y lograr que este mantenga su sabor a través de los años, es algo que aún es difícil de creer por muchos de nuestros competidores, conocedores de que el cacao cambia ligeramente de sabor en cada cosecha.</p>\n<p>Para contarles cómo logramos esta consistencia en nuestro sabor, debemos remontarnos a los años 2004 – 2005, donde vemos a Luker Chocolate como una compañía local empezando a pensar en el mundo y en cuál podría ser la estrategia adecuada para internacionalizarse como negocio a nivel mundial. Es por esos días que se empieza a profundizar sobre el cacao de Colombia del que ya teníamos el sabor identificado y estandarizado por regiones principales del país, y se busca la ayuda de CENICAFE para hacer un estudio con la rigurosidad científica necesaria para permitirnos diseñar una estrategia basada en el sabor del cacao y nuestra capacidad de desarrollar mezclas que conservaran el sabor que prometíamos.</p>\n<p>En esas primeras fases de nuestro negocio internacional, se comprobó de manera científica que los cacaos de Santander, Tumaco y Huila, tenían las características de sabor necesarias para definir unos cacaos de origen con personalidad propia y suficiente diferenciación y volumen para construir una estrategia de expansión internacional. Por esa misma época nos dimos cuenta de que existía una organización llamada ICCO (Organización Internacional del Cacao), que tenía una definición clara para unos cacaos especiales y que se conoce como CACAO FINO DE AROMA, un cacao libre de defectos en el sabor, con un complejo perfil sensorial que no solo refleja la experiencia de quien lo cosechó, sino también el ambiente donde fue cultivado, fermentado y secado. Un Cacao Fino de Aroma que cuente con estos criterios, también ofrece una importante diversidad genética, así como una herencia histórica y cultural, y era exactamente eso lo que creíamos de nuestro cacao colombiano; un cacao que refleja el trabajo de los campesinos de nuestro país, que no solo muestra su cultura e historia, sino que se levanta como un símbolo de desarrollo económico y transformación social en el campo colombiano. La diferencia es que ahora estaba siendo reconocido a nivel mundial.</p>\n<p>Una de las maneras de demostrar, en ese entonces, que el cacao fuera Fino de Aroma, era la relación de teobromina/cafeína, que se usaba como discriminante para diferenciar Cacaos Forasteros de los Cacaos Trinitarios y Criollos, los primeros relacionados con cacao común y los segundos con cacaos especiales por sus características de aroma y sabor. Vale la pena especificar que mientras el nivel de teobromina es similar en todos los cacaos, la cafeína es más alta entre más acriollado sea el cacao.</p>\n<p>Todos estos antecedentes, puestos de manera organizada por un equipo de personas visionarias y decididas a hacer algo distinto, permitieron diseñar e implementar una estrategia de expansión basados en el sabor del Cacao Fino de Aroma, sustentada por años de experiencia de saber hacer chocolate, conocimiento agrícola profundo desarrollado en la Luker Chocolate Granja, y una relación fuerte con los pequeños agricultores cacaoteros de nuestro país.</p>\n<p>En estos 15 años de historia hemos profundizado en el conocimiento científico de nuestro Cacao Fino de Aroma, hemos desarrollado nuevos orígenes y vienen más en camino, podemos definir claramente las características fisicoquímicas de cacaos provenientes de unas 40 regiones del país. Parámetros técnicos como contenidos de vitaminas y minerales, antioxidantes y polifenoles, estructura de los triglicéridos presentes o relación teobromina/cafeína, es información que puede ser usada para el diseño de casi cualquier tipo de chocolate que nuestros clientes demanden, siempre conservando las características de sabor que podemos controlar. Seguimos manteniendo nuestra capacidad de fabricar los chocolates de mesa que le gustan al consumidor colombiano, mientras desarrollamos un portafolio de chocolates para el mercado profesional del mundo. Más de 100 recetas o mezclas de cacao y otros ingredientes, nos permiten tener una oferta insuperable en chocolates hechos con Cacao Fino de Aroma.</p>\n<p>La lista de países que exportan total o parcialmente Cacao Fino de Aroma está compuesta hoy por 25 países de acuerdo con la decisión tomada por el panel de expertos en la pasada reunión de la ICCO en Abijan en abril 13 de 2019. El panel de expertos está conformado por 10 personas, 5 de países no productores y 5 de países productores, del cual hacemos parte, y que se encarga de recomendarle a la ICCO la calificación que debe otorgar con base en los lineamientos establecidos en el Acuerdo Internacional del Cacao. De acuerdo con la información histórica, se han hecho revisiones de la lista de países en los años 1972, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1993, 2001, 2010, 2015 y 2019. Colombia apareció como parcialmente exportador de Cacao Fino de Aroma en el año 1993; en el año 2008 fue incluido por el panel en la lista de países con un cumplimiento del 100% ,y en el año 2010 se llevó al 95%, cifra que se ha mantenido desde entonces.</p>\n<p>Cada vez estamos profundizando más en el mundo del sabor, desarrollamos nuevas variedades de cacao que ofrecen perfiles muy interesantes, mientras incrementamos la productividad de nuestros cultivos y de las regiones cacaoteras donde trabajamos. Estamos explorando nuevas tecnologías que nos permitirán perfeccionar y estandarizar los procesos de fermentación y secado,  todo para seguir ofreciendo los mejores chocolates hechos con Cacao Fino de Aroma de origen colombiano al mundo entero.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'FRANCISCO GÓMEZ', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFWyb8DSqYCCg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=dVNW6XiYzO1lK7W9iY9iwua1HVNapQh8khqRdM0Ibto', details: 'Innovacion and Business Development Vice-president', description: 'Civil Engineer with more than 30 years of experience in food industries, extensive knowledge in the cocoa supply chain and development of international markets.

Desde hace un tiempo, sus habitantes empezaron a formarse como técnicos en turismo sostenible para proyectar su comunidad como una parada obligada en la ruta turística de Necoclí, aprovechando así su riqueza histórica y cultural (Caribia fue el primer asentamiento de la zona y cuenta con una gran diversidad étnica).</p>\n<p>Esta fue una gran oportunidad para apoyar a la comunidad de Caribia ayudándoles a visibilizar en el mundo la energía y la generosidad que las personas llevan en sus corazones, pues creemos que su implacable deseo de seguir adelante es el motor para transformar esta región. Con este hermoso reto entre las manos, el equipo de El Sueño de Chocolate, junto a los líderes comunitarios identificaron una oportunidad para volver más atractivo el corregimiento: darle vida a las casas a través de los colores y así fue como nació Pinta Caribia.</p>\n<p>Para nosotros, Pinta Caribia, es más que una iniciativa, es la metáfora tangible del realismo mágico que existe alrededor de la mazorca de cacao, que no solo da vida a los granos, sino que también construye sueños a su alrededor. Con nuestros corazones llenos de empatía y mucha emoción, comenzamos a materializar la ejecución de Pinta Caribia./p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-7.4768f7ff.jpg\" alt=\"Pinta caribean girls\">\n<p>Fue así como nos pusimos en contacto con la Fundación Orbis-Pintuco (organización con experiencia generando desarrollo y formación en poblaciones vulnerables a través del color en toda Colombia) y en conjunto vimos el potencial de hacer una jornada artística en la que voluntarios de Luker Chocolate y habitantes de Caribia pintarían en equipo hasta la última casa del corregimiento.</p>\n<p>La Fundación Orbis-Pintuco nos ayudó a conformar un programa en el que 20 jóvenes de Caribia se postularon para ser capacitados como técnicos en pintura. Ahora solo nos faltaban los materiales, pues teníamos que recolectar 500 galones de pintura.</p>\n<p>Entre la Fundación Orbis Pintuco, Luker Chocolate y sus colaboradores, recolectamos donaciones para llegar a la meta. Adicional, 30 de nuestros colaboradores, incluido el comité de gerencia,  viajaron como voluntarios para participar en Pinta Caribia, el nombre que decidimos ponerle a esta iniciativa y trabajar hombro a hombro con los trabajadores de nuestra finca.</p>\n<h3>PINTANDO UN SUEÑO</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-8.b85e34a1.jpg\" alt=\"Girl painting\">\n<p>Y finalmente llegó el gran día, el 22 de junio, más de 30 voluntarios y caribianos unieron sus esfuerzos en torno al sueño de convertir a Caribia en el lugar más colorido de Necoclí. La paleta se seleccionó cuidadosamente para representar los colores encontrados en nuestro bosque de cacao, colores que para la población de Caribia tienen un significado profundo: azul que simboliza la tranquilidad, verde que representa la paz que se encuentra en la región, amarillo que representa la prosperidad que brindan los campos de cacao y rojo por el amor que sienten por su tierra y sus familias.</p>\n<p>La dinámica de trabajo fue la siguiente: cada voluntario ayudó a dos familias a pintar sus casas, mientras recibía asistencia de los habitantes del corregimiento que habían sido previamente capacitados por la Fundación Orbis-Pintuco. Además, la comunidad se encargó de preparar el desayuno, el almuerzo y la comida, concretando así un gran trabajo en equipo y fortaleciendo los vínculos entre Luker Chocolate y la población.</p>\n<p>Hombro a hombro, a pesar del calor y el agotamiento, trabajamos durante todo el día por un objetivo en común y este esfuerzo se vio reflejado en los resultados: 100 casas fueron pintadas ese día, desde la escuela primaria, el centro comunitario, la guardería, hasta los parques infantiles.Hoy, un año después, recordamos este día con emoción y nostalgia, pues este fue nuestro primer voluntariado en la región y la oportunidad perfecta para que tanto los Caribianos, como los miembros de Luker Chocolate, nos uniéramos en un solo equipo.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/growing-comunity.598f55e2.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa community\">\n<p>Nos sentimos muy felices de que ellos pudieran reflejar su belleza interior en la comunidad, al transformar a Caribia en un destino turístico vibrante.

Amén”.  Rezo de Don Jesús, cacaocultor de la región del Huila.</q>\n    <p>Con los ojos cerrados, de pie y cogido de la mano de las personas a su alrededor, esta fue la oración que en voz alta pronunció Jesús AGOSTOo Gómez antes de invitarnos a pasar a la mesa. El sancocho de pollo había sido preparado en fogón de leña según se podía notar por su sabor ahumado, por el olor a leña en el ambiente y por el humo que salía por el techo de la cocina de Doña Elvira Quintero de Gómez. La mesa estaba servida con un clásico mantel tejido a mano, muy típico de las casas campesinas colombianas, con platos de diferentes vajillas recogidas durante los años y cubiertos de diferentes estilos y formas. La sopa, el seco y una deliciosa agua de panela estaban dispuestos en cada uno de los 8 puestos que con cierta limitación de espacio le cupieron a Doña Elvira en la mesa de madera. En total éramos 11, con lo cual Don Jesús, luego de hacer su oración, se retiró junto a su esposa Doña Elvira y su hijo, “El mono”, para permitirle a la visita sentarse y almorzar de primeros, pues según él ellos tenían la prioridad. A pesar de haber trabajado toda la mañana en su finca cosechando cacao bajo el sol del Huila (Colombia), y a sus 75 años de edad, se rehusó a sentarse como gesto de atención con su visita.</p>\n<p>Nosotros, 4 personas que veníamos desde Bogotá, éramos en realidad para esta familia cacaotera unos completos desconocidos. Habíamos pedido el favor en las asociaciones ASOPROCAR y ASOPECA de que nos llevaran a visitar alguna finca de la región, pues queríamos conocer de cerca su realidad, vivir algunas horas en su entorno y compartir con ellos un rato sin ningún otro objetivo que escucharlos.</p>\n<p>Tengo que confesar que la llegar al Huila no tenía una idea muy clara sobre cómo nos iban a recibir. Pensé que causaría cierta sospecha nuestra visita y generaría algo de suspicacia pues no sería para nada común. Habíamos llegado repentinamente esperando meternos en el espacio personal de una familia durante todo un día, a cambio de nada. Pensé que se negarían a recibirnos o que nos preguntarían inmediatamente al llegar cuál era el propósito de nuestra visita. ¿Qué pasaría si uno llega repentinamente a una vivienda desconocida en Bogotá y pide el favor de que lo dejan estar allí todo el día? Para mi sorpresa, fuimos recibidos con una gran sonrisa y una amabilidad contagiosa.</p>\n<p>Luego de una corta conversación de bienvenida y de mostrarnos el lugar, de una vez nos sumergimos en el cacaotal, un cultivo de 3 hectáreas con árboles antiguos, de tronco grueso y muy altos: características típicas de una agricultura muy tradicional y prácticas de la zona. Don Jesús iba caminando con cierta dificultad pues un accidente que tuvo cuando joven le había afectado de forma importante su pierna izquierda. No se quejaba, pero se notaba que le costaba bastante caminar. Luego nos confesó que había sufrido 5 trombosis pero que seguía trabajando sin problema. Durante el recorrido nos contó diferentes anécdotas de su vida que espontáneamente le iban saliendo. A la izquierda del sendero por donde caminamos había una quebrada con agua muy cristalina, con piedras muy grandes y vegetación frondosa. La sombra de los árboles de cacao y el sonido de la quebrada creaban un ambiente muy tranquilo y acogedor que sirvió de escenario para una conversación de unas 2 horas. Conocimos la forma en que Don Jesús administraba su finca. A pesar de que no conocía a ciencia cierta cuánto producía, ni tenía ninguna cifra anotada, conocía sus árboles como si fueran la palma de su mano.</p>\n<p>Luego del almuerzo en donde evidenciamos tan especial hospitalidad, pasamos a que la familia nos enseñara a preparar guarapo, una bebida típica colombiana hecha con el jugo de la caña de azúcar. En el patio tenían una máquina antigua para picar la caña, mientras que el “mono” ya había cortado algunas de estas plantas que estaban listas para pasarse por la máquina encargada de extraer el jugo. Todos participamos de la actividad y logramos sacar unos 5 litros de guarapo. Cansados por el esfuerzo físico que demanda esta actividad, pasamos al quiosco en donde Don Orlando, líder de la asociación de cacao y quien trabaja con Don Jesús, nos invitó a tomarnos un aguardiente de sobremesa.</p>\n<p>En el quiosco Don Jesús nos contó más historias de su vida, una de ellas, sobre el accidente de su pierna. Nos contó que a la edad de 20 años él estaba persiguiendo a una muchacha que le gustaba. Una noche, quiso salir en su caballo a buscarla. Su madre le advirtió que no saliera, que estaba muy tarde y que no estaba bien hacerlo. Sin embargo, salió y sufrió una caída que por poco lo deja inválido. La moraleja que tenía para compartirnos al final fue: “Una madre siempre sabe lo que es mejor para uno. Oigan a sus padres siempre y háganles caso”. Al instante, Guillermo Valderrama de 65 años y quien nos acompañaba en el grupo como consultor, anotó: “Así es, quién no escucha a su madre, no escucha la voz de Dios”.</p>\n<p>También nos contó sobre cómo había dejado de tomar alcohol después de viejo, perdiendo así a muchas de sus amistades. Nos contó intimidades de su infancia y sobre sus imborrables recuerdos de la época de violencia bipartidista entre liberales y conservadores -dos partidos políticos colombianos- durante los años cincuenta. Nos contó cómo vio a muchas personas morir cerca de la finca donde creció y también nos habló sobre la violencia reciente. A sus 75 años, narraba estos recuerdos como si hubieran acontecido ayer. Era evidente su trauma, pero también contundente su convicción por el valor del trabajo, el campo, la agricultura y la vida pacífica en comunidad.</p>\n<p>Al momento de irnos, el “Mono”,  quien había sufrido un problema mental por consumo de licor adulterado y quien estaba pasando por un período depresivo y de soledad nos dijo: “Gracias a la visita de ustedes hoy veo mi finca más bonita. Hoy ha sido un día muy especial y feliz para mí”. Este día aprendí más cosas que en un día cualquiera en la oficina de Bogotá; conversé con más empatía; estuve más tranquilo; fui más humano, más feliz; abracé gente que nunca había visto; disfruté de la tranquilidad del campo; conocí gente que a pesar de no haber podido terminar bachillerato, sabían más cosas que yo; fui nuevamente consciente del valor que tiene nuestro campo y de la calidad humana y empuje de nuestros campesinos.</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate seguiremos trabajando con ellos y para ellos, pues son quienes hoy hacen posible que podamos disfrutar de los alimentos que nos da la tierra.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'SERGIO RESTREPO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQEU_fSBYnqwnw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=pqJb74EtssHW43ajcC8aeRAErFY_wdDFWW8NCbfjXzE', details: 'Marketing Vice-president', description: 'I see chocolate as a tool of change.

Solo después de acercarme amistosamente me dejaron llegar a mi nuevo puesto de trabajo y sin saber, una integrante de la pandilla de perros llamada Peggy, se convertiría en mi compañera inseparable de aventuras. En ese momento me di cuenta de que este no era un trabajo del todo normal, pues de ahí en adelante mis jornadas laborales transcurrirían en medio de un bosque de cacao y acompañado de cientos de especies diferentes.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-dog.e4e80138.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa friend Peggy\">\n<p>Es sabido que las plantas, y en general los cultivos, albergan una cantidad inmensa de insectos y de animales, pero la deforestación y el uso intensivo de monocultivos ha hecho que estos hayan migrado o que algunos incrementen desmedidamente su población, a tal punto de considerarlos plagas. Las plantaciones forestales en Colombia se han utilizado con fines comerciales y como herramientas estratégicas para la restauración de suelos degradados y la conservación del recurso hídrico; sin embargo, el efecto de las plantaciones forestales sobre la diversidad local ha sido poco evaluado, especialmente en el papel que juegan como hábitats para la restauración y conservación de la biodiversidad (Haggar et al., 1997, Barlow et al., 2007, Mitra y Sheldon 1993). En el caso de Luker Chocolate, implementamos sistemas agroforestales tanto en Granja Luker como en nuestros cultivos empresariales de cacao en Necoclí (550 ha) y en Casanare (1.000 ha), generando con ellos biodiversidad y un lugar óptimo para la conservación de fauna y flora autóctona. </p>\n<p>Pero, ¿cómo hemos medido la biodiversidad que generamos con nuestros cultivos? Las aves son utilizadas como indicador de biodiversidad de una región, debido a que su abundancia y ocurrencia está influenciada por las características y composición del hábitat del que se encuentran asociadas, son relativamente fáciles de observar y pueden ser censadas a grandes escalas (GREGORY, 2006); RAMÍREZ-ALBORES Y RAMÍREZ-CEDILLO, 2002). Solo en nuestro bosque de cacao en Necoclí existen 96 especies de aves diferentes, casi un 10% del total de aves reportadas en Colombia.</p>\n<p>En Granja Luker no solo medimos la biodiversidad con las aves si no con muchas otras especies que habitan el ecosistema del cultivo y que hoy se han convertido en amigas del cacao. A continuación te contaré algunas de mis más memorables anécdotas con algunas de ellas.</p>\n<p>En mi primer día de trabajo decidí recorrer la granja con Peggy, mientras caminábamos empezó a ladrar y correr desesperadamente persiguiendo un grupo de aves. Al acercarme más, me di cuenta de que estos animales no estaban en el cacaotal por cuestiones del azar; por el contrario, estaban haciendo trampas en los frutos de cacao para atraer insectos que se convertirían en su alimento.</p>\n<p>Poco a poco fue avanzando el día y había llegado la hora del almuerzo. En una oficina común y corriente es normal que este momento se convierta en un espacio para interactuar con nuestros compañeros, y aunque eso era lo que yo estaba esperando, este no era el caso, pues mis colegas eran un poco diferentes. A medida que me acercaba al comedor -al que la manada de perros había llegado de primer lugar- ubicado a 1 km de la casa principal de la finca, me topé con gallinas que también estaban buscando su alimento, así como con una pareja de patos hambrientos y un loro que gritaba “¿quiere cacao?”.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-friends-2.5bfa3000.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa friend parrot\">\n<p>Un mes después, fui a recolectar frutos con los trabajadores de la granja bajo un cielo totalmente despejado; el día estaba soleado y sentí que nada malo podía pasar. Pero, de repente, sentí como si me estuvieran electrocutando la cabeza y la espalda. Comencé a gritar y los trabajadores, acostumbrados a este tipo de situaciones, me dijeron que me retirara la camisa porque estaba siendo invadido por avispas diminutas. Yo les hice caso y logré quitarme los insectos de encima. Decidí volver al lugar del “ataque” para verificar qué me había picado, pero las avispas me volvieron a atacar. A mí me habían advertido que en la vida uno tiene jefes buenos y malos, que inclusive algunos de ellos serán malhumorados, pero no creo que alguien haya sido tan severamente juzgado por un jefe como yo lo fui por esas avispas; seguramente esa era su forma de decirme que tenía que ser más respetuoso con su hogar.</p>\n<p>Del ecosistema de la Granja también hacen parte unos gusanos blancos a los que coloquialmente se les llama gusano pollo y que aparecen en ciertas épocas del año. La primera vez que supe de ellos fue cuando un agricultor estaba realizando la poda de los árboles y uno de esos gusanos se atravesó en su camino, picándolo y dejándolo con fiebre durante todo el día. Estos animales son muy comunes y pasan desapercibidos pues se alimentan de las hojas y viven debajo de ellas.</p>\n<p>Un día todo fue completamente diferente. Mientras cruzábamos un puente de guadua, nos topamos con un pequeño amigo que puede ser terrorífico para algunas personas y fascinante para otras, era una culebra que se encontraba en unos árboles cerca de una quebrada que atraviesa la finca.  Cuando la vimos, mi reacción fue de pánico y decidí alejarme un poco; al parecer, ella estaba acostumbrada a ver humanos porque no se alteró. Uno de los trabajadores la tomó en sus manos para tomarle fotos, ya que esta era una de las “mascotas” de la Granja y estaba siendo protegida por los trabajadores dado que en la región es común que las maten.Después de tomada la foto, el trabajador la dispuso otra vez en su guarida, mientras yo me recuperaba del gran impacto que me ocasionó verla.</p>\n<p>Por último, nunca olvidaré el día en que uno de los trabajadores vio que algo muy pequeño se movía y decidió echar un vistazo. Al mirar descubrió que era una ardilla bebé que se había separado de su madre, por lo que se la llevó a la finca y él mismo la cuidó y la protegió de los depredadores. Al pasar los días, la ardilla decidió emprender su camino, pero hoy es común verla cerca de la habitación del trabajador que la ayudó de pequeña, o comiéndose las mazorcas de cacao del cultivo.</p>\n<p>Estas son solo algunas de las muchas especies que viven aquí y que demuestran el poder que tiene un cultivo de cacao para convertirse en santuario de cientos de animales vertebrados e invertebrados; para ser el lugar donde conviven especies de todo tipo, desde zarigüeyas, armadillos, guatines, perros, gatos, patos, conejos, hasta culebras e insectos. Es menester protegerlos y cuidarlos pues son ellos los encargados de una labor que nos supera a todos como seres humanos: mantener el equilibrio de las poblaciones y la biodiversidad de todo un ecosistema. Mientras ellos hacen una labor tan importante, yo, que me quedé trabajando en la Granja como Analista Agrícola, seguiré dejando que me acompañen y llenen mis días de mayor significado. </p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JUAN JOSÉ HINCAPIÉ', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQF3R8cD2WhDyw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=1h2n3IYyHMZm-VA4MHb0bko7VW_XLXAFZnoyRIqj334', details: 'Agricultural Analyst', description: 'Agricultural Analyst at Luker Chocolate', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-jos%C3%A9-hincapi%C3%A9-toro-b18a12181/', 'Juan José Hincapié']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/lo-que-no-sabias', name: 'Lo que no sabias' }],\n    url: 'un-chocolate-al-dia-mantiene-alejado-al-doctor',\n    title: 'UN CHOCOLATE AL DÍA, MANTIENE ALEJADO AL DOCTOR',\n    cover: 'finished-product-title.jpg',\n    date: 'AGOSTO 2019',\n    content: `<p>Pocas personas conocen los grandes beneficios que trae el consumo regular de cacao. La gran mayoría de los consumidores están convencidos (algunos por recomendaciones médicas), que el cacao y/o el chocolate, son perjudiciales para la salud. Con el objetivo de solucionar esta discrepancia, el Área de Investigación de Luker Chocolate, en asocio con centros de investigación de Colombia y de Italia (University of Molise – Campo Basso, Sannio Tech – Benevento, y University of Brescia) caracterizaron los cacaos de Colombia, Ecuador y Perú, y desarrollaron una variedad de diseños experimentales por más de cuatro años, incluyendo estudios preclínicos y clínicos con 50 voluntarios. Una vez obtenidos los resultados, los discutimos con un grupo formado por los más reconocidos cardiólogos, nutricionistas, nutriólogos, dermatólogos, deportólogos, etc.</p>\n<p>Hoy, tenemos suficiente evidencia científica y técnica para poder afirmar con certeza que el consumo regular de cacao ayuda a mejorar y a proteger la salud de las personas. Pero ¿cuánto chocolate debemos consumir? Nuestra recomendación es dos porciones de chocolate en polvo al día o una de chocolate amargo durante al menos un mes. Esto lo ayudará a:</p>\n<h3>PROTEGER LA SALUD CARDIOVASCULAR</h3>\n<p>Consumir cacao ayuda a reducir el colesterol total y el colesterol malo (LDL), mientras que aumenta el colesterol Bueno (HLD) y reduce o regula la relación omega 6 y omega 3, ayudando a mejorar su salud cardíaca y disminuyendo los riesgos de enfermedades de este tipo. Su corazón se hará más fuerte si además de consumir cacao, empieza a adquirir hábitos de vida saludable en su alimentación disminuyendo el consumo de grasas animales y de harinas, mientras aumenta el consumo de cereales y verduras. Además, le recomendamos hacer ejercicios físicos como caminar hasta lograr 10.000 pasos diarios.</p>\n<h3>PROTEGER LA SALUD GÁSTRICA E INMUNOLÓGICA</h3>\n<p>El cacao contiene fibras (insolubles y solubles) que ayudan a mejorar el movimiento intestinal, permitiendo evacuaciones normales que ayudan a eliminar las toxinas producto del metabolismo de las grasas y los carbohidratos. Estas fibras tienen una característica prebiótica que alimentan a los microorganismos probióticos que mantienen la salud gástrica. Es importante recordar que la salud inmunológica está condicionada en gran parte por la salud gástrica, lastimosamente los colombianos tienen problemas gástricos debido a la poca ingesta de fibras que provienen de cereales y verduras.</p>\n<p>Tip: consuma chocolate y verduras a diario, y notará cómo mejora su salud gástrica e inmunológica.</p>\n<h3>MEJORAR EL ESTADO DE ÁNIMO</h3>\n<p>El cacao posee unas moléculas que actúan como neurotransmisores de mensajes en el sistema nervioso central; una de ellas es la feniletilamina, mejor conocida como la molécula del amor, pues se ha demostrado que el cerebro de una persona enamorada contiene grandes cantidades de esta sustancia que podría ser la responsable de ciertas sensaciones como la excitación, taquicardia, enrojecimiento, entre otras. Este neurotransmisor desencadena, a su vez, la acción de otros neurotransmisores llamadas moléculas de la felicidad como la serotonina (genera sentimiento de amor propio y de respeto por los demás), la oxitocina (genera sentimiento de amor por otras personas y vinculación afectiva) y la dopamina (generadora de alegría y sentimiento de euforia).</p>\n<p>Tip: no se amargue la vida, tómela suave y también tome chocolate, el antidepresivo por excelencia. Realmente funciona.</p>\n<h3>PRODUCIR O ACTIVAR SISTEMAS ENERGÉTICOS DEL CUERPO</h3>\n<p>Sí, consumir cacao ayuda a producir energía o activar la energía existente en el cuerpo. Su contenido de potasio y la activación de proteínas importantes en el proceso de producción de energía hacen del cacao un alimento clave en las mañanas para mantenerse energizado durante todo el día. ¿Lo mejor?, no contiene dosis excesivas de cafeína.</p>\n<h3>MANTENER LA SALUD GENERAL DE TODO EL CUERPO</h3>\n<p>Esta parece una frase bajada del video de algún youtuber. Parece increíble o un tanto atrevido decirlo, o más afirmarlo. Venga se lo explico. Cuando respiramos o nos exponemos al sol, nuestro cuerpo libera sustancias que lo oxidan y que son muy reactivas y peligrosas. Se llaman radicales libres y son moléculas incompletas que van buscando por nuestro cuerpo electrones para completarse. Estos radicales son las causantes de la gran mayoría de enfermedades crónicas no transmisibles que son las que más muertes causan en el mundo, tales como: enfermedades cardíacas, cáncer, diabetes y obesidad. Aunque nuestro cuerpo produce sus propios antioxidantes que neutralizan rápidamente esos radicales libres o sustancias oxidantes, el estrés, no comer a tiempo, fumar, beber alcohol en exceso y no hacer ejercicio, disminuyen la producción de antioxidantes naturales y empiezan a predominar nuevamente los radicales libres. Traducido al español: los malos hábitos nos oxidan. Afortunadamente existen alimentos como el té, las uvas, los arándanos y especialmente el chocolate, que aportan niveles de antioxidantes al cuerpo impidiendo que esto pase. En el caso específico del cacao, este cuenta con una sustancia llamada NFR2, que es una proteína que reactiva los genes que producen nuestras propias sustancias antioxidantes, aumentando aún más la protección contra enfermedades crónicas no transmisibles.</p>\n<p>Por otro lado, el cacao posee cantidades importantes de minerales que facilitan el desarrollo de reacciones biológicas como el potasio, que intervienen en las reacciones de producción de energía y regula el ritmo cardíaco; el calcio que ayuda a la transmisión del impulso nervioso además de proteger contra la osteoporosis; el hierro, que ayuda a combatir la anemia; y el zinc, que ayuda al sistema inmunológico, al desarrollo cognitivo de los niños y a madurar y mantener la actividad sexual a través de los años.</p>\n<p>Como ves, las bondades del cacao van más allá de su sabor inigualable y de su poder de transformar las regiones cacaoteras de nuestro país. Te invitamos a que lo consumas a diario y a que nos cuentes en los comentarios si pudiste evidenciar cambios en tu salud.</p>\n    `,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'HUGO OLARTE', avatar: '', details: 'Investigation and Special Projects Manager', description: 'Dir I&D en Casa Luker', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-olarte-83625568/', 'Hugo Olarte']\n    },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/tomando-posicion', name: 'Tomando posicion' }],\n    url: 'arte-para-sanar',\n    cover: 'healing-with-art.jpg',\n    title: 'ARTE PARA SANAR',\n    date: 'SEPTIEMBRE 2019',\n    content: `<p><small><b>Nota del editor:</b> El año pasado el equipo de Transhuella trabajó con nosotros implementando un proyecto artístico que unió la pintura y la fotografía para reconocer la herencia cultural de las comunidades aledañas en nuestro cultivo de cacao en Necoclí y ayudar a sanar las heridas de guerra.

Del tema hablan hoy expertos, no expertos, jóvenes, adultos, empresarios y gobernantes en todas las coordenadas. Algunos hacen especial énfasis en temas ambientales, otros en sociales, económicos y otros en las relaciones entre todos los componentes. Hay grandes discusiones sobre lo que en realidad significa o, más bien; sobre los caminos que nos debemos trazar como planeta para ser sostenibles. Se enfrentan conceptos, intereses, culturas, etc., pero parece que estamos todos de acuerdo en que es un asunto de temporalidad. ¿Cómo satisfacemos las necesidades de hoy sin comprometer las de mañana? Naciones Unidas logró poner al mundo entero a mirar hacia el mismo norte: los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible que nos marcaron una ruta por la cual debemos transitar como humanidad para que vivamos dignamente, garantizando los recursos para futuras generaciones. </p>\n<p>NACIONES UNIDAS LOGRÓ PONER AL MUNDO ENTERO A MIRAR HACIA EL MISMO NORTE: LOS OBJETIVOS DE DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE QUE NOS MARCARON UNA RUTA POR LA CUAL DEBEMOS TRANSITAR COMO HUMANIDAD PARA QUE VIVAMOS DIGNAMENTE, GARANTIZANDO LOS RECURSOS PARA FUTURAS GENERACIONES.</p>\n<p>Sin embargo, aunque los objetivos estén ahora más claros, todavía nos enfrentamos al reto de su implementación: ¿quiénes?, ¿cuándo?, ¿dónde?, y ¿cuánto dinero se necesita? La discusión toma entonces un matiz entre lo práctico y lo filosófico, entre el propósito superior que como humanidad tenemos y la voluntad de llevarlo a cabo. Surgen las preguntas sobre quiénes deben empezar, si se debe partir de la base o si es responsabilidad de los líderes. En fin, hay más preguntas que respuestas sobre la sostenibilidad. Sin embargo, hay una que es especialmente relevante: ¿quiénes son los jugadores más importantes para que sea una realidad?</p>\n<p>Aquí aparece la muy clásica discusión entre el sector público y el sector privado y su rol dentro de todo esto. Al planteamiento sobre el rol que cada uno debe desempeñar lo precede otro todavía más complicado: ¿es verdaderamente posible que en estos sectores se hable de sostenibilidad? En el sector público, por ejemplo, existen algunos límites a la posibilidad de ser sostenible. Algunos de ellos pueden ser:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Los períodos de administración de la Rama Ejecutiva (cuatro años) son insuficientes para que se desarrollen proyectos de largo plazo de manera sostenida.</li>\n<li>La sobrecarga de normatividad del país no permite avances y flexibilidades en la ejecución de los recursos públicos para buscar que sean económica, ambiental y socialmente sostenibles.</li>\n<li>Construir sobre lo construido no ha sido un pilar de gobierno del sector público, de manera que cada vez se empieza de nuevo y los proyectos no alcanzan a demostrar su capacidad de transformación.</li>\n<li>Las políticas públicas, que son la herramienta que permite mantener buenas prácticas en el tiempo, no son ejecutadas con rigurosidad, su presupuesto sigue dependiendo del alcance que el mandatario de turno les quiera dar, por lo tanto; pueden invisibilizarse hasta el punto de desaparecer.</li>\n<li>La regulación alrededor de temas ambientales todavía no es lo suficientemente rigurosa ni para el mismo sector público.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>El sector privado también se encuentra limitado a la hora de ser completamente responsable en sus prácticas de sostenibilidad económica, ambiental y social:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>El desarrollo tecnológico disponible para generar ahorros y eficiencias es todavía insuficiente o en algunos casos muy costoso.</li>\n<li>Existen dificultades para encontrar, en toda la cadena de valor, aliados sostenibles que se adapten a las necesidades del sector.</li>\n<li>La formación de los líderes empresariales no ha estado enfocada en la sostenibilidad, lo cual sugiere un límite a los grandes cambios corporativos que se requieren hacer en pro de su desarrollo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Es posible afirmar entonces que ambos sectores encuentran grandes límites en el reto de garantizar los recursos de generaciones futuras y en actuar completamente de forma responsable ambiental y socialmente. Aún así, hay una posibilidad que no ha sido del todo explorada para poder achicar estos límites y en cambio, usar las fortalezas con las que ambos sectores cuentan.</p>\n<p>Esta posibilidad implica, en primer lugar, deconstruir la idea de que la sostenibilidad de cada sector únicamente se puede desarrollar de manera aislada. Es imposible que la humanidad viva dignamente en el futuro si cada sector hala para su propio lado y se esfuerza por generar transformaciones solo. La única salida que tenemos es la de conectar, tejer, articular y juntarnos como seres humanos, independientemente del lugar en el que nos encontremos.</p>\n<p>El sector público no puede ser sostenible sin el privado; el privado no puede ser sostenible sin el público, pero a esta fórmula sugiero agregar dos nuevos actores fundamentales: la academia y la comunidad, los otros grandes jugadores.</p>\n<p>Solo en la alineación de esfuerzos entre estos sectores, será posible hablar de sostenibilidad, pues cada uno de ellos cuenta con características únicas, indispensables e irremplazables que terminan siendo las piezas claves para la construcción de ciudades, países y un planeta sostenible.</p>\n<p>Para poder trabajar juntos debemos crear sistemas, herramientas, metodologías, buscar puntos de encuentro y, fundamentalmente, antes de cualquier desarrollo que permita la articulación, debemos, como seres humanos que componemos estos sectores, dejar nuestro ego a un lado, salir de nuestra zona de confort, estar dispuestos a trabajar con personas diferentes, romper con los estereotipos de unos y otros sectores y pensar con empatía. </p>\n<q>EL SECTOR PÚBLICO NO PUEDE SER SOSTENIBLE SIN EL PRIVADO; EL PRIVADO NO PUEDE SER SOSTENIBLE SIN EL PÚBLICO, PERO A ESTA FÓRMULA SUGIERO AGREGAR DOS NUEVOS ACTORES FUNDAMENTALES: LA ACADEMIA Y LA COMUNIDAD, LOS OTROS GRANDES JUGADORES.</q>\n<p>Esto ya es posible, ya se han realizado algunos esfuerzos para que esto pase y ya existen ejemplos de éxito. Sin embargo, sigue siendo en una escala pequeña. El llamado es a que pensemos como uno solo, que seamos por primera vez capaces de renunciar a todo lo que hemos ido construyendo en torno a la individualidad, para que podamos realmente mantener y seguir mejorando nuestro país y nuestro planeta. Ya hemos evidenciado  que el camino de la sectorización no nos ha llevado a ser más sostenibles, es hora de que elijamos trabajar juntos para toda la humanidad, ya no tenemos más tiempo.</p>\n    `,\n    autor: { name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.

De acuerdo con las Naciones Unidas, para el 2050 la población será de 9.700 millones en el mundo, por lo tanto, es necesario cuestionarse cómo y quién suplirá los insumos básicos para la alimentación. La agricultura tiene la capacidad de incrementar los ingresos de las poblaciones vulnerables de manera más eficaz que otros sectores de la economía según el Banco Mundial y, aun así, un gran porcentaje de adultos en estado de pobreza son agricultores. Vivimos en un país que es 94% rural, pero la migración de los jóvenes hacia las zonas urbanas está en aumento.</p>\n<p>En la charla que dimos en el WEF quisimos llevar una mirada integradora, pues no podemos entender a la mujer campesina sin primero analizar la situación del campo colombiano.

Con el fin de darle vida a un chocolate, los granos de cacao pasan por etapas de selección, trillado, tostión, molienda, mezclado (con otros ingredientes), refinado y por último conchado, que es el proceso que explicaremos en este artículo.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conching-process.cac06e80.jpg\" alt=\"conching process\">\n    <p>El proceso de conchado fue descubierto en 1879 por el chocolatero suizo Rudolph Lindt, quien, por equivocación, dejó una mezcladora que contenía chocolate funcionando toda la noche, y se dio cuenta de que esto había cambiado su sabor y textura. El nombre del equipo, “concha”, se deriva de la palabra latina para concha, pues el equipo tradicional que se emplea en la manufactura del chocolate se parece a una concha.</p>\n<p>Hoy en día, el proceso de conchado es el paso final en la manufactura del chocolate, bien sea chocolate con leche o amargo, y es un proceso esencial que contribuye al desarrollo de la viscosidad, la textura final y especialmente el sabor. En el proceso de fabricación del chocolate, hablamos de los “sólidos del cacao” para referirnos a aquellas partículas que contienen todo el color, sabor y la mayor parte del valor nutricional de una barra de chocolate; estas partículas también tienen intensas notas amargas y astringentes, debido a los polifenoles o antioxidantes del cacao, y otros sabores desagradables como el del ácido acético que resulta del proceso de fermentación.</p>\n<p>Este paso del proceso, que consiste principalmente en mezclar, someter la masa de chocolate a esfuerzos de corte y airearla bajo ciertas condiciones de tiempo y temperatura, se considera un paso crucial por dos razones:</p>\n<p>Durante el conchado, las pequeñas partículas de sólidos (cacao, azúcar y leche -si es el caso-) que se comportan como una fase dispersa, adquieren una forma más uniforme y se recubren con manteca de cacao (fase continua), lo cual está relacionado con la viscosidad y la fluidez, las propiedades de textura del chocolate, y la manera en la que el producto terminado se funde suavemente en boca.</p>\n<p>El proceso de conchado promueve el desarrollo del sabor mediante diversos factores como el tiempo, la temperatura y los demás ingredientes de la receta,, pero también elimina la humedad y los sabores desagradables volátiles (aldehídos y ácidos grasos volátiles de cadena corta) que están altamente relacionados con el origen y características de los granos de cacao. Esta es una de las razones más relevantes que hacen que el proceso de conchado en Luker Chocolate sea diferente al realizado en otras compañías productoras de chocolate.</p>\n<p>En la comunidad científica, diferentes investigadores expresan opiniones diferentes sobre el número de fases que existen en el proceso de conchado. Algunos investigadores definen el conchado como un proceso de dos fases: fase seca y fase húmeda. Por otro lado, algunos dicen que este proceso cuenta con tres fases, que son las que realizamos en Luker Chocolate y se describen a continuación:</p>\n<h3>1. FASE SECA:</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-seco.c303fd51.jpg\" alt=\"Dry phase\">\n<p>La masa de chocolate se transfiere de la refinadora, generalmente en hojuelas, para calentarla, mezclarla y airearla. El principal objetivo de esta etapa es permitir la evaporación de algunos ácidos volátiles del licor de cacao y el agua que se originan de los componentes de la receta. La concentración total de ácido acético después de la etapa seca de conchado permanece aproximadamente constante pues no hay agua libre que actúe como vapor de arrastre.</p>\n<h3>2. FASE PLÁSTICA:</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-plastico.196668e1.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic phase\">\n<p>La masa que se mezcló y fue agitada bajo esfuerzos de corte, se calentó y se desgasificó, ingresa a esta segunda fase que llamamos el “paso largo”, en el que las características de sabor se desarrollan mediante reacciones químicas (reacción Maillard y degradación de Strecker) dadas por las condiciones de temperatura y tiempo del proceso, y debido a la gran volatilización del ácido acético resultante de la fermentación del cacao. Se llama “plástica” debido al cambio físico que ocurre en la masa y que convierte los copos en una pasta y la torna más líquida a medida que la manteca de cacao cubre las partículas sólidas. El tiempo y la temperatura desarrollan un rol clave en esta etapa. La temperatura en particular se relaciona más de cerca con el tipo de chocolate que se está produciendo (amargo, con leche o blanco), mientras que el tiempo tiene que ver con factores que van más allá del tipo de chocolate, como, por ejemplo, la calidad y variedad de los granos empleados para producir el licor de cacao.</p>\n<h3>3. FASE LÍQUIDA:</h3>\n<img src=\"/static/media/conchado-liquido.b89fdaad.jpg\" alt=\"Liquid phase\">\n<p>Esta fase es la más corta, y es cuando las propiedades de viscosidad y fluidez atraviesan los últimos ajustes con la adición de manteca de cacao y emulsionantes.</p>\n<p>Teniendo en cuenta que el tipo de tecnología es extremadamente importante en el proceso de conchado (por ejemplo: los diseños actuales de maquinaria son más eficientes en términos de energía y tiempo), por lo general durante la fase plástica los chocolates con leche se conchan a 50ºC para evitar el caramelizado del producto, que ocurre por encima de esta temperatura con la formación consecuente de grumos que se percibirán como arenosos en la boca. Por otro lado, algunos chocolates oscuros se pueden conchar hasta 90ºC debido a su carga más intensa de subproductos volátiles resultantes de la fermentación. Sin embargo, el tiempo de conchado es un punto de discusión muy importante en esta etapa, porque es aquí que la calidad, el tipo y el origen de los granos tienen un rol determinante.</p>\n<p>A lo largo de los años, Luker Chocolate ha construido una relación extremadamente cercana con los agricultores colombianos, compartiendo conocimiento y experiencia, con el fin de garantizar y mantener características excepcionales de calidad al final de la fermentación y secado de los granos de cacao. Con esto, y teniendo en cuenta que los granos de cacao colombiano “Fino de Aroma” son naturalmente complejos en términos de perfil de sabor pues tienen delicadas notas frutales, florales y herbales, tenemos mucho cuidado en la aplicación de temperatura y tiempo de conchado para cada cobertura de chocolate que producimos,, para poder llevar a nuestro consumidor final una experiencia diferente de sabor.</p>\n<p>Aquí en Luker Chocolate, con tecnología de punta y nuestros granos de Cacao Fino de Aroma, nuestro proceso de conchado toma entre 2 y 7 horas, y este tiempo es lo que en realidad nos diferencia en términos de las condiciones de procesamiento. Otras compañías alrededor del mundo que fabrican coberturas de chocolate y trabajan con granos de cacao estándar, pueden aplicar procesos de conchado que toman entre 12 y 78 horas, debido a los altos niveles de ácido acético y otros compuestos que tienen un impacto negativo en el sabor final del chocolate. Esta es una desventaja en términos de eficiencia en producción (costos y energía).</p>\n<p>El proceso de conchado es un paso específico durante la manufactura del chocolate y es muy importante para mejorar la calidad del producto terminado. Sin embargo, la temperatura elevada prolongada y el proceso de agitación con esfuerzos de corte –necesarios para eliminar los compuestos volátiles indeseados y la humedad– presentan desventajas para la eficiencia y costos de producción.</p>\n<p>Ahora que sabes esto, la próxima vez que comas chocolate cierra los ojos, presta atención a la textura a medida que se derrite en tu boca, toma un poco de aire para evaluar el sabor, y recuerda que detrás de esa complejidad de sabores que estás sintiendo, se encuentra la magia del trabajo conjunto de la ciencia y la naturaleza para generar experiencias sensoriales.</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'DIEGO CORTÉS', avatar: '', details: 'Research and Development Professional', description: 'Bilingual Chemical Engineer (English - Spanish), Master in Bromatology and Food Technology, with strong experience in Research, Development and Innovacion in chocolate and other food companies, also in academic environments.

Tradicionalmente, el cultivo de cacao en Colombia era una actividad en la cual los agricultores solían ser muy pobres, no tenían recursos tecnológicos, no adelantaban una gestión administrativa y no tenían la capacidad de proyectar el negocio a mediano o largo plazo.</p>\n<p>Fue entonces cuando se nos ocurrió un modelo de desarrollo empresarial que dinamizara a los pequeños productores y los animara a sembrar cacao. En 2010, Luker Chocolate optó por tener cultivos propios que ayudaran a la compañía a satisfacer su demanda de Cacao Fino de Aroma −sin dejar de lado las relaciones ya establecidas con las asociaciones de cacaoteros en todo el país−, con el objetivo de tener proyectos agroindustriales demostrativos que promovieran la siembra de cacao a gran escala e impulsaran el desarrollo rural. En ese mismo año, la compañía encontró 550 hectáreas de tierra que eran utilizadas tradicionalmente para ganadería en Necoclí, Antioquia, y que luego convirtió en su primer cultivo agroindustrial y en el mayor cultivo agro-productivo de variedades Fino de Aroma del país, diseñado bajo un sistema agroforestal.</p>\n<p>Hoy en día este cultivo emplea a más de 180 personas (anteriormente empleaba a 5) y se han sembrado más de 600.000 árboles nuevos, generando un alto impacto económico, social y ambiental en las comunidades aledañas al cultivo. Aquí nació El Sueño de Chocolate, nuestra visión de largo plazo para generar cambio en las regiones productoras de cacao donde trabajamos.</p>\n<p>Luker Chocolate fue la primera empresa en atreverse a iniciar un modelo empresarial de cultivo de cacao en Colombia, concretamente, en cultivo de Cacao Fino de Aroma. En primer lugar, esto exigió un importante cambio de mentalidad, que implicó pasar de tener fincas a tener compañías, adoptar tecnología, capacitar el recurso humano, implementar procesos administrativos transparentes y eficientes, y, en general, mirar el negocio a una escala mucho mayor. Lo anterior apunta a garantizarle resultados a Luker Chocolate, pero también a hacer un trabajo de integración vertical para garantizar la trazabilidad y la calidad del cacao. Adicionalmente, este modelo irradia ejemplos de buenas prácticas productivas, de herramientas tecnológicas y de modelos de inversión en la zona para las regiones productoras. Así mismo, produce iniciativas productivas paralelas, mejora las condiciones de las zonas aledañas y aumenta la calidad de vida de la gente que las habita. Finalmente, le ha mostrado al país que se puede tener proyectos de cacao a gran escala rentables.</p>\n<p>Necoclí fue el primero de varios proyectos, seguido por una plantación del doble de tamaño en el departamento de Casanare, en un cultivo anteriormente utilizado únicamente para la producción de palma de aceite. El proyecto en el Casanare cuenta con 1000 hectáreas de cacao en un sistema agroforestal con palma, el cual hoy en día ha generado 500 empleos formales.</p>\n<p>De igual forma, se prevé el desarrollo de otro cultivo ancla en el departamento del Huila, como parte de una iniciativa para promover la siembra del cacao en ese departamento. El cultivo ancla tiene como principal objetivo el acompañamiento in situ a agricultores de la región, como parte de un gran programa de fomento en el que se invite a otros habitantes a sembrar cacao. La meta es poder ampliar el cultivo de cacao en la región con 350 hectáreas nuevas de cacao y 450 hectáreas de renovación de cultivos en 6 municipios, lo cual impactaría a 375 familias.</p>\n<p>For me, it is a source of pride to know that this company is not afraid to undertake major projects, rather it has been a pioneer and example throughout the country for this very reason.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'GUIDO SIERRA', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHh3XbrtXhmKQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=PD2w7KFQty_KkqUIHiUYgJNfA9GLs_S1MTMSqczVWWI', details: 'General Manager Luker Agricola', description: '17 years of professional experience in human talent management and generation of high performance teams, Financial Management, Process Optimization, Installation and commissioning of industrial facilities and Development of Supply Chains with successful results in increases in efficiency, productivity, reduction of costs and value generation through the satisfaction and loyalty of customers and suppliers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-sierra-1301a339/', 'Guido Sierra'] },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/valor-compartido', name: 'Valor Compartido' }],\n    url: 'chocolate–esparciendo-el-amor-por-el-mundo',\n    title: 'CHOCOLATE – ESPARCIENDO EL AMOR POR EL MUNDO',\n    cover: 'stand-banner.jpg',\n    date: 'OCTUBRE 2019',\n    content: `<p>Hacer un viaje a Luker Chocolate en Colombia y vivir #LukerExperience en carne propia, resultó ser una experiencia reveladora para la dueña de Le Salon Du Chocolat, Dawn Shrives. De su visita, regresó con un nuevo aprecio por la producción de chocolate y llena de ideas sobre cómo su empresa, ubicada en Chichester, Sur de Inglaterra, puede apoyar el trabajo que se está haciendo en ese país.</p>\n<p>Establecido en 2004, Le Salon Du Chocolat es un estudio de chocolate en el cual sus visitantes pueden poner a prueba sus habilidades con talleres y fiestas temáticas. Dawn también dicta charlas y demostraciones para organizaciones y escuelas locales.</p>\n<p>Pero la pasión de Dawn es la “calidad” del chocolate, desde la fuente de granos de cacao hasta el producto terminado. Ella explica:</p>\n<p>En particular durante los últimos 20 años, a medida que la demanda por los granos de cacao ha aumentado, forzando el incremento del precio, muchas de las grandes marcas de chocolate que ahora amamos están usando menos cacao, completando sus productos con grasas vegetales alternativas más económicas y con harina de trigo. Por lo tanto, los productos terminados se describen como “barras” o “con sabor a chocolate”, pues ya no contienen suficiente cacao como para poderlos llamar “chocolates”.</p>\n<p>Los chocolateros artesanales están volviendo a usar chocolate que contiene solo los ingredientes básicos necesarios. La cobertura (discos de chocolate) que uso en mis talleres es hecha en Bélgica, y resulta de una mezcla de granos de cacao provenientes por lo general de África, que es la fuente de alrededor del 70% de todos los granos de cacao que se cosechan. Sin embargo, también uso coberturas hechas con granos de cacao de otras regiones de cultivo, como Colombia, Perú y Costa Rica que, cuando son de origen único, en lugar de ser mezclas, le dan al chocolate un sabor específico de esa región.</p>\n<p>Dawn fue uno de los veinte chocolateros que viajaron a Luker Chocolate, en una visita para experimentar de primera mano cómo se cultiva y cosecha el cacao, cómo se convierte en chocolate, y cómo Luker apoya a los cacaocultores, a sus familias y a las comunidades locales. Luker, una empresa familiar colombiana establecida en 1906, es una compañía proveedora de cacao y fabricante de chocolate que cree que la producción de cacao puede producir un impacto social positivo: “creemos que el chocolate hace del mundo un lugar mejor”. Luker Chocolate compra casi el 40% del cacao total producido en Colombia, y todos sus granos de cacao cumplen con sus estándares de “Fino de Aroma”; un cacao fino que corresponde a solo el 8% del cacao total del mundo.</p>\n<p>“El viaje me abrió los ojos”, dijo Dawn. “Luker es una de las empresas más grandes de Colombia. Lo que diferencia a Luker de otras compañías es que fabrica en Colombia sus productos, desde los granos hasta las barras, lo que quiere decir que usa azúcar, leche y mano de obra colombianas, y exporta el producto terminado en lugar de solo los granos de cacao. De modo que los productores de leche y de caña de azúcar también se benefician directamente”.</p>\n<p>La travesía de chocolate de Dawn inició apenas aterrizó en Bogotá, con un desayuno tradicional de chocolate caliente, almojábana y queso en la fábrica de Luker. A esto le siguió una cata de chocolate.</p>\n<p>“Cada una de las etapas de cómo se cultivan, cosechan y procesan los granos en nuestro chocolate tiene un gran impacto en el sabor final”, explicó Dawn. “Un ejemplo es saborear un chocolate hecho con granos tostados a 130 grados y compararlo con uno tostado a 160 grados. ¡La diferencia en los grados había hecho que el chocolate fuera casi incomible!”.</p>\n<p>El grupo voló a Granja Luker, un centro de capacitación e investigación alrededor del cacao que entrena a los agricultores colombianos para mejorar su productividad y que también les vende material vegetal. Desde su fundación en 1962, Granja Luker ha educado a 700 agricultores al año para que siembren y cosechen granos de cacao Fino de Aroma.</p>\n<p>Algo memorable para Dawn fue su visita a Necoclí, Antioquia, ubicado muy cerca del paso hacia Panamá. Hace algunos años Luker sembró 600.000 nuevos árboles de cacao en 550 hectáreas de esa área, creando 180 trabajos nuevos en un área conocida por haber sido víctima de conflicto armado. Luker ha apoyado en gran medida a los habitantes de las comunidades aledañas al cultivo, incluyendo las tres escuelas del área. Dawn dijo:</p>\n<p>Visitamos dos de las escuelas dentro de la plantación de cacao y nos pidieron que les lleváramos regalos educativos a los niños y les contáramos algo sobre nuestras vidas. Yo llevé tarjetas postales de Chichester y de Wittering para mostrarles a los niños dónde vivo, y para que las pudieran usar para escribirme y luego yo llevarlas a niños de las escuelas locales de mi ciudad. Me encantaría poder establecer una conexión entre las escuelas de West Sussex y de Colombia.</p>\n<p>Caribia, una de las comunidades aledañas al bosque de cacao, se ha transformado gracias al Sueño de Chocolate de Luker. Este proyecto nació como la visión de largo plazo de Luker Chocolate para liderar desarrollo social y económico en las regiones productoras de cacao. Luker empezó a preguntarse sobre su responsabilidad como compañía. ¿Qué más podían llevar al campo, a las personas, a los niños y a los vecinos? El Sueño de Chocolate, junto a voluntarios y aliados, han ayudado a pintar casas, han incentivado a los habitantes del pueblo a iniciar emprendimientos de artesanías con tejidos tradicionales de caña, cocina, belleza, turismo, entre otros.</p>\n<p>El viaje transformó la perspectiva de Dawn:</p>\n<p>Me siento tan privilegiada de haber tenido la oportunidad de visitar Colombia y de aprender sobre la historia de las personas que cultivan un gran chocolate.</p>\n<p>Tras usar su chocolate por más de una década, y ahora ver el trabajo que Luker y su proyecto Chocolate Dream están realizando, me emociona mucho ayudarles a compartir esta historia. María de Restrepo fue miembro de la familia fundadora de Luker Chocolate. Todos los sábados, en Manizales, salía a su ventana y regalaba chocolate a las personas sin hogar con el único propósito de consolarlas y asegurarse de que tuvieran comida en sus estómagos. En ese momento, no se había investigado sobre la “felicidad de comer chocolate”, pero lo que ella hizo y el chocolate que regaló debió haber reconfortado a muchas personas. Supongo que al usar chocolate Luker hoy en día, estoy haciendo lo mismo, no solo en términos de apoyar a las familias que se encuentran en la fuente de esta travesía, sino también al llevar la felicidad de compartir su fino chocolate con mis clientes. Los suizos llamaron al cacao “Theobroma” en el siglo XVIII, que significa “alimento de los dioses”. Me gusta pensar que soy una versión moderna de una “diosa de chocolate”, y que es mi deber llevar el mejor chocolate a las manos de todas las personas del mundo. Y si puedo hacer esto de una manera en la que sé que estoy ayudando y apoyando a las familias que lo proveen, pues mucho mejor.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'JOSÉ MALDONADO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGWmXeWsufD9Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=sPc6xh78N7oYmS61XLxym_XcKLYzzBJ9PSp5kyFCPQk', details: 'SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY ANALYST', description: 'Sustainable Supply Analyst for Luker Chocolate, focused on agricultural development and sustainability projects of the company\\'s value chain.Project leader for organizations of cocoa producers and small- scale farmers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-miguel-maldonado-v%C3%A9lez-79a818114/', 'Jose Maldonado'] },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/valor-compartido', name: 'Valor Compartido' }],\n    url: 'cacao-bosques-y-paz',\n    title: 'CACAO, BOSQUES Y PAZ',\n    cover: 'banner-cacaos-w.jpg',\n    date: 'OCTUBRE 2019',\n    content: `<p>En Luker Chocolate, todos los días partimos y buscamos crecer desde nuestro propósito superior: hacer del mundo un lugar mejor, ayudando a otras empresas a crear productos con propósito, utilizando nuestro chocolate como una herramienta de cambio. Este futuro y cambio que soñamos empieza en las regiones productoras de cacao en Colombia, de donde obtenemos el mejor Cacao Fino y de Aroma. Pero no nos queríamos quedar ahí. Por eso, hace unos años, decidimos poner todas nuestras fuerzas y ofrecerle soluciones reales al campo colombiano; de ahí nace “El Sueño de Chocolate”.</p>\n<p>El reto es enorme. En Colombia, se produce cacao en 27 de los 32 departamentos, lo que genera una gran dispersión geográfica en la producción y un sin número de barreras para los productores y sus familias. Además, las principales regiones cacaoteras de Colombia han sido históricamente zonas de conflicto armado, minería ilegal, narcotráfico etc.; y por desgracia, hoy en día muchas lo siguen siendo. A pesar de que los obstáculos se presentaran una y otra vez en el camino, nuestro sueño es más grande. Sabemos que solos no podemos y que la llave para alcanzar nuestra meta es el trabajo en equipo; solo así lograremos que “El Sueño de Chocolate” deje algún día de ser una aspiración.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Necoclí\">\n<p>Un reflejo claro de la unión y los esfuerzos en conjunto es la iniciativa Cacao, Bosques y Paz en Colombia. Este es un proyecto público-privado que tiene como objetivo promover modelos productivos de deforestación cero, que favorezcan la protección y restauración de los bosques en la cadena de suministro del cacao, pero que además, aporten en la construcción de paz de nuestro país.</p>\n<p>La iniciativa nace en marzo de 2017 cuando se lanza la Declaración de Intención para la Iniciativa Global Cacao y Bosques, liderada por la World Cocoa Foundation, The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), organizaciones sin ánimo de lucro y más de 35 empresas del sector privado; quienes firmaron los acuerdos macros para la acción conjunta en Ghana y Costa de Marfil, principalmente. En julio de 2018, Colombia se convierte en el primer país de Latinoamérica y tercero en el mundo, en adherirse a la iniciativa y firmar su propio acuerdo.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/cocoa-forest.dfaf6862.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa forest\">\n<p>Nosotros, Luker Chocolate, fuimos la primera empresa del sector privado en creer y firmar la iniciativa Cacao, Bosques y Paz en Colombia; siendo partícipes de la planeación y estructuración del plan de acción, el cual fue lanzado oficialmente el pasado mes de septiembre en Bogotá. Decidimos ser parte de este proyecto porque sabemos que la base de todo lo que hacemos está en las regiones productoras de cacao, porque esa es nuestra fuente de inspiración y la oportunidad que tenemos para transformar comunidades.</p>\n<p>Así entonces, esta iniciativa pone en marcha su plan de acción a 10 años, liderada por los ministerios de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible, Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural, la industria cacaotera representada por Luker Chocolate y la Federación Nacional de Cacaoteros (Fedecacao), The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) y la World Resources Institute (WRI), con el apoyo de la World Cocoa Foundation.</p>\n<p>Serán 10 años de trabajo, hombro a hombro, en los cuales se busca alcanzar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>45 hitos en total (25 a corto, 12 a mediano y 8 a largo plazo).</li>\n<li>76 actividades a 2 años.</li>\n<li>51 indicadores de gestión para las actividades a 2 años.</li>\n<li>Más de 73 indicadores que medirán el sistema de información.</li>\n<li>5 grandes resultados a 2030:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Modelos productivos de cacao con deforestación cero.</li>\n<li>Instrumentos financieros que consoliden modelos de cacao con deforestación cero.</li>\n<li>Sistemas de monitoreo, verificación y trazabilidad.</li>\n<li>Fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad cacaotera para bosques y paz.</li>\n<li>Estrategias de comunicación y transparencia.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Para la etapa de implementación de este proyecto, también se unirán las fuerzas de nuevos firmantes como la Embajada de Suiza (SECO), Climate Focus, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Organización Alisos, Rainforest Alliance, Lök Foods, Mariana Cocoa Export, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), WWF y el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).</p>\n<p>Cacao, Bosques y Paz es un hito muy importante para la cacaocultura en Colombia y todo lo que hay detrás de ella. Será el primer gran pacto por el desarrollo sostenible de la producción de cacao en el país que harán los tres sectores de la economía. Este proyecto será un aporte muy importante en la protección y conservación de toda la riqueza natural con la que convive el cacao, además; transformará las realidades que hoy en día viven las familias cacaocultoras del país, ayudará a superar dificultades y ofrecerá un mejor futuro para el campo colombiano.</p>\n`,\n    autor: { name: 'JOSÉ MALDONADO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGWmXeWsufD9Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=sPc6xh78N7oYmS61XLxym_XcKLYzzBJ9PSp5kyFCPQk', details: 'SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY ANALYST', description: 'Sustainable Supply Analyst for Luker Chocolate, focused on agricultural development and sustainability projects of the company\\'s value chain.Project leader for organizations of cocoa producers and small- scale farmers.', linkedin: ['https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-miguel-maldonado-v%C3%A9lez-79a818114/', 'Jose Maldonado'] },\n    recommended: [{ img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'SMALL CHANGES, BIG REVOLUTIONS', subtitle: 'DICIEMBRE 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/small-changes-big-revolutions' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'COCOA FRIENDS', subtitle: 'AGOSTO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/cocoa-friends' }, { img: 'planting.jpg', title: 'THE RIGHT SPARK', subtitle: 'JULIO 2019', url: '/blog/tomando-posicion/right-spark' }]\n  },\n  {\n    breads: [{ href: '/blog', name: 'Blog' }, { href: '/blog/innovacion', name: 'Innovacion' }],\n    url: 'beau-cao-un-chocolate-que-cuida-la-belleza-desde-el-interior',\n    cover: 'beucao-banner.jpg',\n    title: 'BEAU CAO, UN CHOCOLATE QUE CUIDA LA BELLEZA DESDE EL INTERIOR',\n    date: 'NOVIEMBRE 2019',\n    content: `<p>Durante más de 30 años, la feria comercial anual PLMA (Private Label Manufacturing Association) ha sido el evento más importante en Estados Unidos donde retailers e industriales obtienen información y conocen proveedores para desarrollar sus marcas privadas.

Los productos serán exhibidos en el Idea SuperMarket, un lugar en la feria que muestra lo que supermercados, hipermercados y retailers de todo tipo, están haciendo con sus marcas. La selección de los productos que se mostrarán aquí está basada en el nivel de innovación de los mismos, después de que un jurado probara el producto postulado y de esta manera pudiera comprobar su nivel de innovación. Un par de semanas después de haber postulado nuestras ideas, tuvimos la gran noticia de haber sido seleccionados con dos innovaciones: Beau Cao y Protein Pud.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/beau-cau.cbf77ddd.jpg\" alt=\"Beau Cao\">\n<p>Hoy te contaremos de qué se trata Beau Cao. Beau Cao es un producto desarrollado a partir de VitalCao, una línea de ingredientes funcionales de Luker Chocolate la cual ofrece cocoas en polvo con los mejores beneficios provenientes del cacao. Tras 11 años de intensa investigación y gracias a todas las posibilidades que nos ofrece el estar presentes en toda la cadena de valor de nuestro chocolate, desde el grano de cacao hasta el producto final, desarrollamos un método de producción único, con patente en proceso, en donde controlamos la prácticas posteriores a la cosecha (fermentación y secado) y el proceso industrial para obtener una gran cantidad de antioxidantes del cacao. Todo esto ha dado como resultado un portafolio de productos naturales que aportan beneficios a la salud en la era moderna.</p>\n<p>Una de las innovaciones más fuertes de VitalCao es su capacidad de proteger las células del cuerpo de los rayos UV. Las propiedades antioxidantes de VitalCao previenen la formación de radicales libres que se generan a partir de la exposición a rayos ultravioleta. Partiendo de los beneficios de VitalCao y entendiendo que la belleza es un proceso que se debe cultivar de adentro hacia afuera, en Luker Chocolate decidimos lanzar al mercado Beau Cao, un producto que no solamente es indulgente sino que cuida de tu piel reconstituyéndola desde el interior.</p>\n<p>La fórmula de Beau Cao ayuda a proteger las células hasta un 60% más que un chocolate regular, lo que significa que tu cuerpo se protege de los rayos del sol desde su interior. Adicionalmente, ayuda a reducir inflamaciones que se puedan presentar en tejidos de la piel hasta un 26% más.</p>\n<p>En Luker Chocolate hicimos un estudio médico de la mano de Ikemia IUCT (grupo empresarial español de alta tecnología orientado a desarrollar y explotar nuevos productos) que probara científicamente los beneficios del consumo diario de Beau Cao. Durante 1 año, 10 sujetos saludables, con edad promedio de 35.4 años, con piel clara tipo II (de acuerdo a la escala de FitzPatrick), consumieron de 4 a 6 gramos de VitalCao. Luego expusimos áreas de 1×1 cm de piel sin broncear del lado interno del antebrazo a dosis crecientes de radiación solar simulada (SSR, simulador solar multipuerto modelo 601, luz solar, Glenside, PA). Con el estudio encontramos como resultado un incremento significativo en el efecto foto protector de la piel, efecto directamente relacionado a la alta actividad antioxidante del producto.</p>\n<p>Estudios clínicos realizados por nuestra área de Investigación y Desarrollo, prueban que la versión de Beau Cao con el 45% de cacao, tiene 75% más flavanoles (componentes que se encuentran en algunos alimentos y que ayudan al organismo a protegerse del daño producido por agentes oxidantes como los rayos ultravioletas, la polución, sustancias químicas presentes en los alimentos, etc.) que un chocolate de leche regular con el mismo contenido de cacao. Asimismo, la versión del 58% y del 70% de contenido de cacao (esta última es la que presentaremos en PLMA), contienen 57% y 47% más contenido de flavanoles respectivamente que un chocolate regular.</p>\n<p>En esta infografía encontrarás más información sobre nuestro producto:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/ficha-beau-cao.4216f6f5.jpg\" alt=\"Beau Cao Infographic\">\n<p>Estamos orgullosos de lanzar por primera vez un producto completamente innovador en el sector de la belleza y de participar en el Idea Supermarket de PLMA.</p>\n<p>Si te interesa Beau Cao, anímate a trabajar de la mano con nosotros; esta innovación podría ser tuya y hacer parte de tu portafolio de marca privada.

Además, presentamos una de nuestras últimas innovaciones en producto: Beau Cao, un chocolate que cuida la belleza desde el interior, el cual exhibiremos en el New Product Expo, una plataforma donde solo algunas de las compañías que participarán en la feria podrán exhibir sus últimas innovaciones.</p>\n<p>Hoy, el protagonista de este blog es el Protein Pud, el segundo producto innovador que exhibiremos en ese mismo espacio. Una formulación que hemos desarrollado y puesto a disposición de nuestros clientes quienes la deseen tener en su portafolio de marca privada. Aquí les contamos cómo fue la creación de este producto.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/protein-pud.e083a995.jpg\" alt=\"Protein pud\">\n<p>Actualmente, las personas tienen menos tiempo para estar en sus hogares y preparar las comidas del día. A esto, se le suma que hay otras prioridades como su vida social y el cuidado personal. Es por esto que, los snacks se han convertido en la solución perfecta para alargar el tiempo de consumo entre una comida y la otra, pero al mismo tiempo generan satisfacción.</p>\n<p>Partiendo del comportamiento de estos consumidores, es que decidimos desarrollar el Protein Pud: un pudín instantáneo de proteina de soya endulzado con stevia que no necesita refrigeración. Un snack perfecto, pues su preparación es rápida, es saludable, delicioso y te hace sentir satisfecho. Su formulación innovadora permite que tan solo agregando un poco de agua fría se obtenga la textura deseada. Además, es un producto hecho a base de plantas, por lo tanto es apto para veganos. Y para hacer que la experiencia del Protein Pud sea aún más memorable, se le pueden agregar diferentes toppings como frutos secos, fruta deshidratada o fresca, nibs de cacao, etc.</p>\n<p>Fueron más de 6 meses en los que nuestro equipo de Investigación y Desarrollo trabajó en búsqueda de la formulación adecuada para crear el balance entre textura y sabor. Primero, se buscaron las materias primas que nos dieran la sensación cremosa y suave que queríamos que tuviera el producto. Luego, estaba el reto de que este mantuviera el sabor exquisito del chocolate hecho con Cacao Fino de Aroma que nos caracteriza y que; además; mantuviera la textura. Sin embargo, el reto más importante fue encontrar la forma en que todo lo anterior se mantuviera en una preparación hecha con agua fría, sin que el pudín se resquebrajara o se volviera granuloso.</p>\n<p>Más allá de ser indulgente e innovador, el Protein Pud es buena fuente de proteína, uno de los nutrientes con mayor presencia en el cuerpo humano y que es vital en la formación de músculos y cumple un papel fundamental en el buen funcionamiento del sistema inmune. Además, aporta calcio, un complejo de vitaminas como la vitamina A, vitamina B2, vitamina B12; y minerales como hierro, zinc y cobre.</p>\n<p>Con la fórmula perfeccionada, la pregunta final era ¿cómo mostrarle al mundo y a nuestros clientes esta innovación? Para esto, desarrollamos dos presentaciones de producto. La primera, ‘on the go’, es la presentación individual, diseñada para las personas que quieran tener un snack y consumirlo en cualquier momento y lugar. La segunda, ‘home presentation’, es ideal para preparar algo delicioso y saludable mientras se está en casa alejado de la rutina.</p>\n<p>En esta infografía encontrarás más información sobre nuestro producto:</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/ficha-protein-pud.b6ddb06e.jpg\" alt=\"Protein pud infographic\">\n<p>En Luker Chocolate nos sentimos muy orgullosos de presentar nuestras últimas innovaciones y que, tanto el Beau Cao como el Protein Pud, estén presentes en el Idea Supermarket de PLMA.</p>\n<p>Si te interesa el Protein Pud, anímate a trabajar de la mano con nosotros; esta innovación podría ser tuya y hacer parte de tu portafolio de marca privada.

Luker en su llegada decide no solo tener el mejor cultivo de Cacao Fino de Aroma en el país, sino convertirse en un modelo de sostenibilidad donde las personas fueran el centro, el fin último.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/bosque-necocli.12b8874a.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Necoclí\">\n<p>Después de 7 años de impactos positivos en las comunidades vecinas a las 550 hectáreas de bosque de cacao, en el 2017 uno de los corregimientos más beneficiados del proyecto tomó la iniciativa de la mano del equipo de El Sueño de Chocolate, de celebrar esta llegada histórica de la compañía a sus vidas a través de un festival.</p>\n<p>Caribia, un territorio donde no había llegado el Estado, ni otras empresas privadas, no había celebrado ninguna festividad en años, no tenía fiesta patronal y esta era la mejor oportunidad para iniciar una nueva tradición: El Festival del Cacao.</p>\n<p>En el 2017 inició este hito para las comunidades afro-caribes, afro-chocoanas e indígenas que habitan este territorio. La fiesta y la celebración fueron un éxito; hoy incluso lo comparan con la llegada de la energía eléctrica hace 40 años. Así que había que continuar con la tradición, hacerla patrimonio del territorio, convertirla en la celebración de la cosecha de cacao y de sus efectos en la vida de los locales.</p>\n<p>Y así fue, en el 2018 decidimos hacerla nuevamente y ahora estamos planeando, como un solo equipo, entre Luker Chocolate, los locales, los líderes comunitarios y la Fundación Luker, lo que será el festival más esperando del año.</p>\n<p>Esta planeación ha supuesto grandes revoluciones desde hechos que, en principio, parecían irrelevantes como la definición de la agenda de actividades que se iban a desarrollar. Juntos empezamos a reunirnos para definir cronogramas, personas, presupuestos, aliados, actividades, etc.</p>\n<p>Durante este proceso de consensos y disertaciones descubrimos la importancia del diálogo cultural, social, empático y respetuoso entre las creencias de unos y otros.</p>\n<p>Teníamos dos temas que nos distanciaban: las peleas de gallos y el reinado de belleza, tan tradicional en la cultura colombiana. Así que sobre estos temas empezamos a conversar.</p>\n<p>Desde la compañía, de manera muy respetuosa, propusimos ir haciendo un cambio, no hacer las peleas de gallos y empezar a generar conciencia ambiental y animal. Por otro lado, con el reinado, propusimos una transición que creíamos que iba a tardar: pasar de celebrar y honrar la belleza física de la mujer a honrar y reconocer el talento de esta y su rol en los más de 5 grupos étnicos que conviven en el mismo territorio.</p>\n<p>Nuestra postura respetuosa de la cultura arraigada pretendía que con el tiempo fuéramos modificando creencias y comportamientos, y que el Festival del Cacao pudiera reflejar una manera conjunta de ver la vida, donde las personas, los animales, la naturaleza y la cultura merecían el mayor de los respetos.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/foto-tarima.0cef3648.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Festival\">\n<h3>Tuvimos una gran sorpresa, una hermosa sorpresa.</h3>\n<p>Nuestras propuestas, lejos de ser desechadas y generar discordias, fueron inmediatamente comprendidas, pero además de eso vimos cómo ya estaban incorporadas estas posturas en ellos de manera individual. Todos en su propia reflexión personal habían tenido estas inquietudes, pero no habían llegado a lo colectivo y el Festival del Cacao se estaba convirtiendo en un vehículo para esto, para poner ciertos temas sobre la mesa.</p>\n<p>En una conversación de planeación se le dedico más de una hora y media a reflexionar sobre el reinado de belleza; se tocaron temas liderados por ellos mismos alrededor del gran talento de sus mujeres, del cambio de comprensión sobre el rol de la mujer, de su importancia en la cultura y de las diferencias entre una y otra etnia en ese entendimiento. Se reflexionó sobre lo que significa poner a una joven a desfilar en una pasarela en un territorio por años machista, el riesgo que representa y el mensaje que esto envía a los niños y niñas.</p>\n<p>Fue increíble ver y oír en las voces de aquellos a quienes a veces se les considera no educados o atrasados en tendencias del mundo, cómo desean aportar a la equidad de género, al empoderamiento femenino, a la educación en derechos humanos, cómo el vehículo para logralo es un festival que en este caso no significa una fiesta común sino un ritual, un encuentro para crear valores, para reinterpretar creencias y para celebrar la abundancia y las oportunidades que un producto, el cacao, les ha llevado a sus vidas. Igual sucedió con la pelea de gallos, el consenso alrededor de este tema fue muy rápido y todos decidimos resaltar valores de cuidado al medio ambiente que esta práctica no refleja y por lo tanto fue eliminada de esta agenda.</p>\n<p>Salimos de este encuentro no solo con una agenda nueva, con concursos de mujeres talento y con recorridos ambientales, sino también con la firme convicción de que estas acciones que a veces no parecen tener tanto impacto, como un festival, al final no son más que la manifestación de la reinterpretación de la cultura de una comunidad y su encuentro con otras creencias y comunidades.</p>\n<p>Fuimos testigos de un cambio que en un país de tradiciones no es fácil presenciar todos los días. El Festival del Cacao 2018 fue un homenaje a los agricultores, a las mujeres, a los animales y a la naturaleza.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/media/abrazo.55a56497.jpg\" alt=\"Cocoa Festival\">\n<p>En tres días estaremos viviendo la tercera edición de este encuentro mágico, El Festival del Cacao 2019, ¡Bienvenidos sean todos!</p>\n`,\n    autor: {\n      name: 'JUANA BOTERO', avatar: 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFburD-lKe7tQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1581552000&v=beta&t=OrPNQWmiurHcatseEVuDih5SDGN16X30sgHlTTP8ymg', details: 'Sustainability Director', description: 'Lawyer from Eafit University with an emphasis on public international law from the University of Salamanca, Spain.
